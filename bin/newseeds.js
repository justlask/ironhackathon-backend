I convinced a co-worker who is new to the country to try this tasting tour with me and we were both blown away. Paige is a wonderful host and has a wealth of knowledge about beer. You can definitely tell it's her passion! The tour is roughly 3 hours and covers 3 completely different breweries in a very walkable area. We were able to taste a flight of beer at each stop and even though I love beer, Paige let me switch it up and I tried a couple handcrafted sodas and a cider at Callister! Delicious! It was probably for my benefit as the amount of beer was much more than I anticipated. Overall a great experience especially for those who are serious beer lovers and are interested in learning more about the local scene. Highly recommend!! "

I thought I knew just about all there was to know about beer (especially Vancouver beer) but I still managed to learn a few new things this weekend.

Paige was very knowledgeable in all of the breweries that we went to and even worked or is working at all three. She kept conversations going and was very good about not just talking to one person but walked around and discussed tastings and interests of which beer is (Website hidden by Airbnb) all.

As a former employee of the breweries we toured, she has an insider's knowledge of each of their histories, approach, successes, even their business models! Our tour even included spending time in the back of house areas and a chance to chat with one of the brewmasters.\n\nPaige is working through the four levels of cicerone accreditation, so is serious about the science and flavour components of beer - and it shows. But more than that, she is a consummate booster of local small business and a budding entrepreneur in her own right. Her enthusiasm was contagious and our group ended the evening with hugs all around. Highly recommended experience to all. Be prepared to try all styles (and strengths) of beer. "

The neighborhood is  fantastic, great to go out, full of restaurant, green and bars. It is one of the best areas in Mexico City to walk around\n2. The house is nice and the breakfast is fine\n\nThe bad\n1. You see various pictures on the site but then you don't know what you will get. I don't know if we were unlucky but we got a tiny room (no picture of that were on the site) so you don't (necessarily) get what you see\n2. Our room had a problem, the toilet was not flushing so we asked to be changed and after some negotiations the person working there realized this was really a problem and changed us. \n3. We slept for one night in a nice room however when we came back in the evening our room was occupied by someone else. The people working at the house had taken all our stuff and moved it - I find it incredible, it was the first time, that someone would be doing this - we had left a lot things in the room and things had to be moved and obviously be put in a totally different order. \n4. We were told that in our old room the toilet problem had been fixed but it was not true. Even worse, the guy working there pretended I was being annoying and it had been fixed until when I obliged him to come and check by himself- the toilet was still not flushing (so we could not use it). He accepted it but could not do anything. \n5. We were offered the option to go sleeping elsewhere for that night but it was already 10.30pm - and we would have had to go back the day after. I declined and was promised the day after the toilet would have been fixed\n6. The day after the toilet was finally flushing but an awful smell would come out. It was late, we were exhausted so decided to still spend there the last night but not go back. \n\nI had explained to Fer0do I would leave this review and I was sorry for that, it is not nice to leave a bad review but I think it is fair for other people. In the end he was kind and did not charge me for the laundry (a couple of shirts and one pair of trousers). I found that a kind gesture but frankly not enough to cancel all that had gone wrong. \n\nOverall\nBased on my experience, I would suggest to guests to look for some other place in Condesa. \n\n"

Fer0do, the owner, and his staff will make you feel right at home. These guys go above and beyond to make sure you experience is perfect (for what it's worth, I used to work in the hospitality industry and have fairly high expectations). Staying at Condesa Haus was definitely one of my favorite parts of the trip. My friend and I both agreed that the Porforio Room was the coolest room that either of us had ever stayed in. The roof top deck is perfect for lounging at the end of the day, or all day for that matter. Breakfast was informal and tasty and a great time to hit up Fer0do for recommendations. He'll draw you a map and make sure you know exactly what to do. By the end of the trip we had a collection of his maps. Ask him about the history and themes of each room. Ask him about the restaurant in the cave behind the pyramid. Ask him to take you out for mezcal;) The property is an old estate that he and his partner tastefully modernized. Such a great place. I highly recommend Condesa Haus. Can't wait to go back someday!"

This is unlike all our other airbnb experiences where the apartment was privately owned. As a result,there is housekeeping, reception staff and breakfast. By far the best part of our stay was the reception staff. Friendly, helpful, informative. In a casual way they are the ones that really made the stay a pleasant one. Our room, which was on the second floor and faced the back, was really basic. Small, creaky floors, dim lights, lumpy foam pillows, very little closet/storage. BUT.....clean, great WIFI and TV, decent washroom and shower, little or no street noise. \r\nI would say equivalent to a 3 star hotel. The location in Condesa could not be better. Steps to Starbucks, cafes and restaurants. The metrobus on Insurgentes is a 10 min walk. There are two Metro stops about a 10 min walk. Roma is a pleasant 20 min walk. Polanca and the museums were a bit far for us to walk, but are certainly possible. The taxis were always able to get us back to Condesa Haus without a problem as the location seems to be well known. We read about all the problems with taxis, but never had a bad experience except that metered rides from the same locations would vary quite a lot. We could be in a taxi for 20-30 minutes and get charged 150 pesos and be in one for 5 min and get charged 115 pesos. Other than that, we always felt safe and for the most part taxi drivers were friendly. \r\nTo sum up. Fer0do was easy to communicate with and because there was a reception desk, the hotel could be called at any time. The staff was really great and helped us throughout the week. They seemed genuinely happy to help us. The hotel itself, an old building that has been cleaned up and painted, was never an issue. Maybe the bed mattress, pillows and sheets could use an upgrade in future, but although not the best quality, all was clean and tidy. Location, fantastic. \r\nCondesa Haus was not our first choice and I think Fer0do has better properties as well, but because of the holiday season a lot of places were booked out. So I was not expecting a lot and in the end we had a very very pleasant stay. Although we might look elsewhere when we return to Mexico City, I would certainly not hesitate to return to Condesa Haus.\r\n"

The owner suggested that I stay in another of his B&Bs (Distrito Condesa) near by instead. I stayed there for two nights, On checkin (I arrived around 15:00) I had to wait about 20 minutes on the street for someone to come and open the door. the rooms are very old, very basic furniture, bathroom is very old, water leaking on the floor and into the room. Worst of all is the sound insulation, I could not sleep the second night because I could hear the guest in the next room clearing his throat! as if he was in the same room as me. The noise of someone going up and down some metal stairs connected to the outside of the property until 2am resonating into the room, the noise of some machine working on and off all night. All in all, terrible experience and would not recommend it to anyone."

Overall a very pleasant and relaxing experience. \r\n\r\nThe one complaint I would have would be about the building itself. Most of the older beautiful buildings in the Condesa area don't have insulation so you may hear EVERYTHING from each of the rooms and it echoes across the whole place. Not sure how this problem might be addressed, but just a heads up."

They put up an outstanding Day of the Dead altar while we were there, and had extra umbrellas, bottle openers, whatever you needed! Great place and wonderful hosts. Location is superb and a few blocks away from a main drag full of cute cafes,  bars, and restaurants."

It is in an excellent, safe neighborhood with nearby restaurants worth exploring.  Staff was even very welcoming to my parents that actually were staying at a Hotel over in Polanco section of city the 2 times they came by to meet up with those of us staying at Condesa Haus.  Daily breakfast was very appreciated and gave our family a quiet time to chat before the each day's activities."

The claw tub was a great addition to the room, it also has beautiful light throughout the day and big windows - such a dreamy room, hard to leave! Bed was very comfortable and quiet to sleep at night. \nLocation is great for exploring the Condesa/Roma area. Staff were very friendly & helpful. \nUnfortunately breakfast was disappointing and needs improvement - I was never shown or offered a full menu during my stay and the orange juice was not fresh but from concentrate. \nLardo however is an easy walking distance and does an amazing breakfast/brunch - highly recommend. \nI also highly recommend staying at Condesa Haus while in CDMX, especially for longer stays for more of a homely vibe. \nThanks Fer0do! I will be back."

The premium\r\nbuilding would feel at home in San Francisco's SOMA district.\r\n\r\nHowever, I much preferred Nath's Roma Norte neighborhood, an up and coming\r\narea composed of small, leafy plazas with fountains and historic Spanish\r\nColonial Revival buildings interspersed with contemporary construction and\r\nsome small universities. The area is reputed to have one of the largest\r\nclusters of top restaurants in Mexico City. Cafes are also abundant. The\r\narea maintains a bit of an edge and is a reasonable walk to the happening\r\nCondessa area just to the south. The loft is also about ten minutes walk to\r\nMetro stations to the east or west.\r\n\r\nNath was a friendly and attentive host who went above and beyond any\r\nexpectation for accommodating me. She spent a good while inquiring as to my\r\ninterests and then came up with a half dozen suggestions that she wrote\r\ndown for me. She also was kind enough to drive me at Museum Row and open\r\nher network of contacts to me.\r\n\r\nNath's spacious loft is fresh and clean and sunny. It's decorated in a\r\nsmart, busy professional-meets-university professor (think overflowing\r\nstacks of books) style with mid-Century modern pieces added to the mix.\r\n\r\nThe loft's headliner is the bedroom with a decadent king size bed and\r\nsumptuous sheets and pillows, done up in a hotel suite manner with a couch,\r\nshag rug and flat screen TV. Disclaimer: I'm normally not a fan of lofts\r\nbecause I need darkness in order to sleep; not a problem at Nath's.\r\n\r\nAt under $150 a night, Nath's property is right-priced. A nice, trendy\r\nhotel two blocks away was asking $100 more for their starter, single\r\noccupancy room. Nath was responsive, flexible, and overall good to deal\r\nwith and her listing was accurately and honestly described. If anything,\r\nshe has undersold it."

Our stay at Naths in Roma- one of the coolest areas of Mexico City was all the better for staying here. Nath's apartment was extremely clean and we had everything we needed for our stay. The apartment itself is a quiet retreat from the busyness of the city and offers a beautiful terrace where you can enjoy the morning light. Nath's apartment was bright and airy and we would highly recommend to anyone! Nath was fantastic to communicate with and provided us with a fantastic list of local recommendations.

The neighborhood is great, with lots of places to eat from great street tacos to high end, and with the 24-hour doorman extremely secure. The metro is walkable, but uber and cabify are so tempting and easy to use in Mexico City.  Look forward to returning."

Nath is creative and it shows in her decoration, her fittings, her art and her books. The space is bright and airy and unfussed while still retaining tonnes of character and charm. The building has a 24h doorman and the neighborhood is safe and practical. The terrace is gorgeous and the bedroom upstairs is spacious yet cosy.\r\n\r\nTo call Roma Norte (the neighborhood) the best place in MC would be an understatement, you are very literally surrounded by the prettiest streets, the best restaurants and bars and wonderful shops. \r\n\r\nHighly recommended!"

The location is great, it feels like Roma and is walkable to both the boutique area of Roma/Condesa but conveniently close to Juarez for the mall, banks, markets and subway station. But my favorite aspect of Nathalia's apartment is the modern and open living space with the huge stone terrace. I highly recommend picking up some pastries and coffee from Panader\u00eda Rosetta Roma and enjoying the morning sun on the terrace. Bedroom was nice with good blinds for sleeping in and a comfy bed. Nath also left some fresh fruit and a jug of water upon arrival and was very responsive to all my messages. "

Nathalia has furnished it with great style. It is hidden away in the complex of flats behind a grand facade of an elegant early 19th century building. There is 24 hour security provided by the most charming guards you are likely to meet. Nathalia is kind and responsive. The whole affair is highly recommendable."

I would definitely stay here again!"

The location was amazing, close to wonderful cafes and restaurants, some boutique clothing stores, metro, taco stands, banks, ecobici and fantastic coffee!\r\nNathalia was an amazing host, the best I've had. Very easy to contact and quick to help if I had any questions or concerns. Very caring and concerned for me to have the best stay :)\r\nI stayed her for almost 2 months because I enjoyed it so much.\r\nI will be back as soon as I can, I loved this place :)"

The building has a twenty four hour doorman, which made us feel very secure at all hours.\n\nThe apartment is very charming, with lovely art and books everywhere. A well appointed kitchen would making cooking very easy, if that was desired. There are two bathrooms, and we always had hot water when we needed it. \n\nThe balcony is very nice to sit outside and enjoy the morning sunshine. I really enjoyed my stay at Nath's and would return in a heartbeat."

The apartment was as described from the photos: full of light and plants and books, a great location in Roma, and security at the entrance to boot. The neighborhood was a bit sleepy on Dec 31 and Jan 1, which we were surprised by (coming from NYC!) but that's to be expected. It was aboht a 30-45 min walk to the center, which we did almost every day, and were able to get a great feel for the neighborhoods if Mexico City we walked through. We loved walking around toward Condesa, through all the gorgeous plazas. Importantly the apt has a big percolator for morning coffees, a grocery store around the corner (for bottled water and quick breakfast supplies). Also a few blocks from an excellent bakery. Nath left us great suggestions and was an easy and communicative host. Highly recommend!! "

It wasn't an issue for us, but worth keeping in mind."

Although I did not have the opportunity to personally meet Nicholas (he was away on vacation himself), throughout the reservation process he was very helpful, and he answered my questions very promptly.  He arranged for a friend to be there upon my arrival to give me the keys and to help me get settled in.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is very pleasant, spacious, comfortable and homey.  His ecletic collection of artwork adds a lot of personality to the place.  The cleaning lady comes in once a week and gives everything a thorough cleaning.  Nicholas had a more than adequate supply of jugs of purified water on hand.  No need to go out and buy bottled water.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is very interesting with a lot of wonderful architecture and an \"trendy\", upper middle class atmosphere.  I felt safe walking around even late at night.  There are a lot of restaurants in the area. It would take you months to try them all.  Everything you need... supermarket, pharmacy, ATM, laundry, etc... is within walking distance, and the bus stop and subway station are close so that you can easily get to other parts of the city.\r\n\r\nI loved having my own refuge amid the hustle and bustle of Mexico City, and I definitely hope to return!\r\n"

They are both artists and have written books about Mexico City; a copy is available at the apartment.\r\nThe apartment has all normal facilities (including a full bath), it is nicely decorated (see the pictures on the website) and has many pictures, books about art and cooking and finally a collection of CD's to listen to. In short, a home-away-from-home. \r\nThe Condesa area where the apartment is located is a truly enjoyable area, with many shops, cafes and restaurants. As Europeans we enjoyed walking around this historic Art Deco area. To us it also seemed very safe as it is an area where people live. The Parque Mexico is just around the corner. The Condesa area is also central for sightseeing with most sights a short and cheap taxi ride away or with public transportation (which we did not use). \r\nThe apartment is highly recommended (Website hidden by Airbnb)"

We were received by Nicholas's partner who patiently awaited our (delayed) arrival, on a Friday night no less, and then took the time to chat and give us some great recommendations about where to go that night. It's no wonder that he authored a guide book on Mexico City and that Nicholas has written a guide on Mexican cuisine in the city (with an award winning blog to match). Both books are conveniently available for your use, and we were quite thankful to have them.  Nicholas and his partner are also artists, which can be appreciated in the eclectic decor with rich textiles, antiques and pieces collected from around the world. You can imagine that each item has a unique story and, juxtaposed against the original art deco moldings and features of this historic apartment, it made for a beautiful atmosphere to relax in before and after our daily sightseeing journeys. It's also a great base to do your exploring from: conveniently located in one of our favorite barrios, la Condesa, it has an abundance of gorgeous art deco buildings, nightlife, restaurants, galleries and greenery. And it\u2019s only a short walk to its slightly more hipster neighbor, Roma, another great barrio to explore. It felt extremely safe walking around la Condesa, even at night, and it wasn't uncommon to bump into dog walkers or joggers running on their tree-lined avenue, once a hippodrome, at any hour. The subway was also easily accessible from their apartment, which we relied on heavily during our stay in addition to taxis (Nicholas provided the number of a reliable company). I see in one of the reviews that there was critique about it being a bit cold. We came in March and it was a bit chilly in the city at night (almost a 20 degree drop from the day), but that was also easily fixed by the abundant extra blankets around the apartment and having brought our warm Canadian clothing. Anyhow, that's just a matter of preparing for the weather before you come.  Other details were a fully equipped kitchen with a small balcony overlooking the inner courtyard, nice hot showers, filtered water, a big screen tv in the bedroom with a dvd player in case you want a night in, and a good wifi connection. All in all, we wouldn't hesitate to come back to this apartment on our next trip to Mexico City - and we are definitely planning on returning to the D.F. one day to finish our exploring. A great place to stay in a great city. Thanks Nicholas and Jim!"

I found the location noisy as the bedroom is right on the street, but it was a weekend and lots of party goers outside and police sirens.   Sitting area is light and airy but no view and as someone who likes to throw open windows and have outside living, I felt it rather claustrophobic in general.  The living spaces were clean.   The bedroom needed to have the windows thrown open and a blast of air through as the atmosphere in there was rather stale.   The pillows could do with an upgrade too!   I requested a floor standing heater but it was unavailable on arrival so kindly Nick supplied an extra blanket for the bed which looked a little grubby.  All in all it is an attractive apartment in an excellent location."

I was really surprised by Condesa. I knew it was convenient and had lots of restaurants. I didn't expect it to be so pretty, leafy and quiet. A true refuge in a crazy city. The bedroom in the apartment was on the second floor facing the street yet it was still very quiet (except for Friday night until about 11). Everything we needed was close by: supermercado, farmacia, sitio, turibus stops, etc. We also loved being so close to the lovely park. This was my favorite airbnb experience ever (and all but one have been very good). "

Apartment ended up being perfectly located near loads of restaurants and parks, and Ubers everywhere were cheap.

If you like to cook, or just bring back food to the apartment, this is the place for you:  well-stocked kitchen is an understatement.  And, of course, the location:  you're in the hip Condesa with great restaurants and places to walk in the evening;  and, at the same time you're just across the Insurgentes from Roma Sur where you'll find even better (and cheaper) food in the fondas, puestos, and Mercado Medellin.   If you're lucky enough to be here on a Tuesday, don't miss the Condesa tianguis, the great weekly market about 10 minutes walk away.  Or, walk north into Roma Norte for more great restaurants and entirely different feel with its Porfiriano architecture.  In the past, we've used taxis and the metro, but Uber now makes it even easier to get around:  depending on traffic, you are 20 minutes from the Centro and even closer to the museums in Chapultepec.  Nick is a great host:  easy to reach and always a source for good eats in Mexico City and elsewhere in Mexico."

I'd recommend bringing ear plugs for sleeping, since the downstairs studio (where we stayed) is near the street, which has a lot of action. We'd definitely stay there again (with earplugs)! It's a perfect little studio -- lovely design, nice little kitchen (with all the dishes, etc. one could need), comfy couch and a great desk/workspace. "

A couple of blocks from the apartment is a big supermarket and walking to the center of Coyacan is easily done by foot in ten minutes. The studio is sparsely decorated but has everything you need. The floor is amazing and so is the Acapulco chairs, I wish I could take the whole studio back to San Francisco and place it here! Mexico City was an amazingly good experience and I'll be back for sure! Wouldn't hesitate where to stay!"

Loved waking to the sound of the birds and going out for an invigorating jog at Viveros Coyoacan just minutes away. If you go up to the terrace on the roof you can see Frida Kahlo's blue house, which practically next door. Trisha also provided tips on the area, dvd's, and a well stocked collection of take out menus from nearby restaurants. The washer and dryer downstairs was also a plus since I travel light.\r\n\r\nI would definitely stay there again next time I go back to Coyoacan!\r\n\r\nThank you Trisha."

My partner and I are both artists and this was a perfect location for those interested in the history of Frida Kahlo and the neighborhood she called home. \r\n\r\nThe staff were very helpful and friendly. The space was full of light and charming. The best part was the small patio in the back and access to the roof space where I spent my mornings sketching and planning out the day's activities. \r\n\r\nIn terms of its location and access to other parts of the city, I wouldn't say it was super convenient. The closest Metro stop is realistically 20 minutes away, and once you reach the metro it can take some time to get to certain parts of the city like the Zocalo and Chapultepec. However, we did not have any trouble navigating and exploring the city using the recommended secure taxi and other safe transportation apps (Uber just launched in the city), which were very reasonably priced. The neighborhood was quiet and safe at night. We spent several evenings walking to the plaza where we enjoyed great cuisine and a lively atmosphere.  \r\n\r\nI would definitely consider staying here again on a future trip. "

Trish is an interesting, creative person and a great host, very obliging and ready to provide information. It was great knowing she was there across the patio. The apartment feels spacious and fresh, is very light and airy, is beautifully and simply decorated, and has everything you could need. There is a rooftop terrace virtually overlooking Frida Kahlo's house/ museum, which is directly behind the apartment. I spent a few days just hanging out in Coyoacan as it is a beautiful, interesting and creative neighbourhood with a great atmosphere, a number of museums (Frida, Trotsky museums both extremely close to the apartment) and other points of interest, beautiful squares and parks, some interesting shops and galleries, lots of great food - restaurants, cafes, bars - and a wonderful market. I was on my own but felt quite safe walking around the local area even in the evening. It was quite easy to walk to access the metro station/s to get to Centro and other parts of Mexico City. It's a bit of a walk to the station but I didn't mind that at all, especially as it's such a great place to walk around (in fact I walked on different days to each of the three different metro stations in the area) - it's also possible to hop on a local bus to get to the metro. \r\n\r\nAs an alternative to staying right in central Mexico City, and especially if you're inspired by Frida and/or Diego and want a taste of bohemian Mexico but still with the convenience of easy access to everything else that Mexico City has to offer, this is an amazing place to stay.

The biggest plus is that it's literally right around the corner from La Casa Azul. Trisha went out of her way to assure our brief stay was enjoyed to the max. She not only informed us of a handful of her local favorites, but connected us with her personal driver for a day trip outside of the city, prior to arrival. My only regret is not being able to stay longer than 48 hours!"

Trisha kindly agreed to us dropping our luggage at the apartment before check-in time, which was really helpful to us. \r\nThe apartment is decorated in a simple stylish manner - the use of colour is just beautiful - exactly as shown in the photos. The only thing we didn\u2019t realize from the photos was that the apartment is on the second floor, accessed by an external spiral staircase (not a problem for us, but may be something to consider if you have big luggage or mobility problems). We found the apartment was clean & quiet; the bed was very comfortable & the water pressure in the shower was great. Loved the way the bathroom was decorated! We didn\u2019t really cook, but it was very handy to have the kitchen facilities available to prepare food. The terraces outside were an added bonus - hummingbirds visited the potted citrus trees that were in flower. \r\nCoyoac\u00e1n is a lovely historical peaceful area of Mexico City & the locals were amazingly friendly & helpful to us as we bumbled around not speaking any Spanish!  The apartment is around the corner from Frida Khalo\u2019s Casa Azul & is only a couple of blocks from the market & main squares at the centre of Coyoac\u00e1n & the Museo Nacional de las Culturas Populares. We found there were plenty of taxis to take us to the centre of Mexico City & the airport.\r\nWe loved staying here & would recommend the apartment for its comfort, peacefulness & convenience, & will definitely check out its availability when we return to Mexico City.\r\n"

There is a steep curving staircase leading up to the unit, and as I have recently taken a bad fall and must use a cane, Trisha insisted that I enter through her own home and office, to make it easier for me! She left the doors unlocked so I could come and go safely. Lovely people, lovely location - you could wander for days through Coyoacan and still not see it all. Best was the Day of the Dead celebrations in a nearby plaza. Mucho gracias, Isobel too, for making my stay so comfortable and enjoyable!"

We will keep in touch and we hope to see you in Toronto during TIFF.\nBesitos to Juli, Isabel and Teo!\n\n- The Ryans and Lorenzo"

She offered to arrange a driver for us when we mentioned wanting to go to the pyramids- and we are really glad we took her up on it. She even let us borrow a movie one night when it was pouring rain and we couldn't go out.

Trisha is kind as kind can be and Teo, the housekeeper, keeps the place spotless. It's like a home away from home!"

The location was around the corner from Frida Kahlo's house. The apartment had a ton of natural light, a fully equipped kitchen and captured the essence of Mexican decor and charm. It was within walking distance to all our wedding festivities and the lovely zocalos, markets and cafes. Trisha made sure we were comfortable and gave us many recommendations for coffee, food, and shopping. "

It's this amazing compound-type house with access to the roof overlooking a beautiful tree lined street. There are flowers everywhere and the neighborhood is generally very quiet. I forgot that it's really not too far from the highway. There are multiple spiral staircases, and the apartment is drenched in sunlight at all times. \r\nTrisha was an excellent host, keeping in touch with us but not being at all overbearing. She called us an uber to the airport when we left which was unexpected and extremely kind. Our *only* complaint was that the cleaning fee doubles the price of the room, which seems a bit misleading. Still, the place was nearly spotless (I think that was Teo's doing - we didn't interact much but she was also very kind!) and we felt very comfortable there. The flowers and the sweets on the table were such a nice touch. We'd love to stay with Trisha again - we didn't want to leave DF! "

The place is stunning - Trisha has put her original creative touch on a beautiful Coyoacan studio, and the roof terrace is truly marvellous. It was a real delight to arrive at 6.30 in the morning and hear the concert of birdsong and watch the rising sun above the jacaranda trees from the terrace - from which, by the way, you get a view down onto Frida Kahlo's garden! Trisha was away most of the time we were there, but Teo (the wonderful Mexican lady who works there) looked after us brilliantly. She let us use the phone to make a couple of calls, gave us advice on taxis, etc.  Thanks for everything, Trisha, I can't wait to be back!"

The location is one of the best and a 10 min please take walk to Coyoac\u00e1n and literally around the corner from Fridas home. I would stay here again for sure!"

She provided us with many tips for places to dine and shop around Coyoac\u00e1n, and we enjoyed all of the ones we tried (which was most of them). She's also simply a very cool and caring person, and I wish we would have spent more time talking.\n\nThe home is beautiful and feels very secure. It's right around the corner from Museo Frida Kahlo and just a few minutes walk to many other things. Getting an Uber is super quick and inexpensive if you need to visit other neighborhoods, which we did daily. \n\nWe would stay here again in a heartbeat and thoroughly recommend booking with Trisha if you're looking to stay in Coyoac\u00e1n."

El departamento no es realmente independiente de la casa principal. El acceso es a trav\u00e9s de una escalera de caracol, lo que hace dif\u00edcil el traslado del equipaje y el desplazamiento de personas mayores o con dificultades motoras. En nuestro caso, parte de los utensilios de cocina no estaban limpios y hubo una fiesta ruidosa en la casa principal una, de las noches de nuestra estancia."

Subway only 5$ each journey and easy to use.  \n The apartment is  comfortable and has a very well equipt kitchen, little terrace area, within a complex of other apartments and a office area next door, spiral staircases to each level.\n The water worked well and plenty of hot water, sprays from the shower onto the floor otherwise wonderful.  Use of washing machine and a place to hangout to dry.\nWiFi worked OK, the router was in the office near by. Trisha was friendly and helped with any problems and suggestions of places to go.\nWe had no problems and enjoyed our stay here, lovely flowers and extra thoughtful things in the apartment.  The only problem was the floor, it was hard to keep clean.   We were able to park on the street and had no problem with a parking space outside the house.   \nFrida Kahlo Museum just around the corner."

I emailed Trisha to let her know because she had made special arrangements to be available personally when I arrived.  Because of the late cancellation, I certainly did not expect any refund.  Trisha responded immediately, first suggesting I reconsider as she thought Coyoacan in March was the perfect place to heal a broken heart.  After mulling it over, I decided not to go and emailed her.  To my surprise (and without me asking), Trisha refunded $100 and added she would find ways to make up the rest of what I lost should I come down in the future.  This level of concern for me as an individual certainly tops any AirBnB experience I've every had, and I have never had a bad experience.  Thanks, Trisha!"

Trisha is a smart, sharp, and very helpful and thoughtful lady.  She welcomed us into her home (during our honeymoon) with fresh flowers, a bottle of wine and a sweet note to congratulate us! She even hand drew us a really good map of where to go/who to ask for/etc in like 5 seconds. (I will be framing it)  \n\nYou will be steps away from everything you need, tons of things to do, and Coyocan is beautiful!  It is a bright space for sure. With all the windows you will be smelling the flowers, waking with the sun, and feelin' the breeze all from the comfort of \"your own apartment\" .\n\nFor picky ppl: bed=firm, and the main access route is a small metal spiral staircase you will have to get used to (not a big deal at all, just don't pack 5 LV trucks full of clothes).  Thanks again, Trisha!"

Trisha is a gracious host who is there when needed, leaving the independent traveller alone, helping those who require more help.

As I result I had to leave a place that truly felt like my first home in Mexico City and I could have stayed here forever! Firstly, Trisha's responsiveness to messages and willingness to help me sort out the details of traveling to a new place are what every solo travel wishes for in an Airbnb host. And on my first night there, she graciously went for a walk with me to show me the \"lay of the land\" in Coyoacan. Speaking of Coyoacan, it is a hidden treasure of culture, beautiful spaces and a VERY authentic CDMX. Having spent time in the hot spots of this city (aka. la Roma and la Condesa, and Polanco) I found Trisha's neighborhood to be a perfect \"Bienvenidos\" to a city so large and at times even overwhelming; and a charming oasis to return to after touring around. If you're hesitant about being too far from the action, don't be. While it is true, it's about a 30-minute drive to some of the above mentioned hot spots, keep in mind that an Uber to anywhere of note is about 100 pesos (or $4 or $5 US) ANY time of day or night. In exchange, you will love waking up to the quiet tranquility of a neighborhood that feels like a small town within a big city. There are endless cultural centers within walking distance - like Casa de Cultura Jes\u00fas Reyes Heroles, and book stores (check out Centro Cultural Elena Garro); a Buddhist center...a beautiful yoga studio with some amazing teachers, not even 100 yards away from the (Website hidden by Airbnb) excellent bakery with delicious coffee - Pan Verde, one of the best movie theaters I have ever been too - Cineteca Nacional; and in addition to traditional markets, a lovely organic grocery store and cafe an easy 15-20 minute walk away through Coyoacan's main plaza and past charming homes and through beautiful, sometimes cobble stoned streets. Oh! And it's home to one of CDMX's best chains El Jarocho...a true Mexico City establishment that you can find on almost every corner of Coyoacan, but apparently no where else in other parts of the city. I will miss it all, but will be back again soon! I haven't even talked about the apartment itself - super clean, great linens and bedding, so well equipped, comfy bed, reliable Wi-fi, airy and bright...yada yada yada... All the usual things people say about a great Airbnb, except this one is better :)"

          "transit": "One huge advantage for your travel agenda is our location. Even though the geographical center of the new-born State of CDMX is the Coyoacan borough, Mexico City spreads beyond its state's borders to the north and to the east, with the geographical center being displaced to the north. The Miguel Hidalgo borough, to the which Colonia Escand\u00f3n pertains, conforms, together with Cuauhtemoc and Venustiano Carranza, the actual geographical center of the metropolitan area; which translates into more transportation services at hand, plus faster and easier transfers to and from any place in the city. Our area offers you have a wide array of transportation choices that allows you to move around and take a glimpse of the city. There are 2 subway stations (Tacubaya & Patriotismo), 2 metrobus stations (Antonio Maceo & De La Salle), the #172 Eco-bici station (bike rentals), and the E-conduce Ciencias station (scooter rentals).

One has a king size bed, another has 2 queens, and the third has 2 doubles. It's secure, also, you need 4 keys to get through the 3 gate/doors before the actual door. The neighborhood is mostly very quiet and the neighbors are friendly. There's a kitchen, dishwasher, and clothes washer/dryer.\r\n\r\nIt's on a back street in the Escandon neighborhood, so most taxi drivers need to be shown the location on a map or have it explained. You are also a 5 minute walk from either the Tacubaya or Patriotismo metro (subway) stops. There is a grocery store nearby, also.\r\n\r\nIt's a good place to share with friends, if you're willing to be a little bit away from the fancier Condesa and Polanco neighborhoods."

The kitchen was wonderfully stocked with kitchen utensils and the fridge was large enough to accommodate a lot of groceries.

In particular, our hosts were so gracious and helpful.  They recommended great places to eat, offered taxi advice, and even left us with nice little goodies to welcome us in the house.  Mexico City is a wonderful place to visit, and staying at a warm welcoming home like this is the best way to experience it."

It's spacious rooms and generous and well appointed bedrooms made us feel like we we're staying in a high end hotel (or with rich relatives!). The neighborhood itself is very quiet and well maintained (as is the entire complex that this house is part of). It was equally nice to have the convenience of a large grocery store only a couple of blocks away--and the police station nearby made us feel safe, although Colonia Escandon is a very safe neighborhood. It's really great that it is such a close walk to Colonia Condesa too (literally next door), with all the hip bars, restaurants, and shops. And equally convenient is the Metro stop--located on the rear of the big grocery store--which, for 35 cents a ride--will hook you up to all the great spots in this great city. Most of all, we felt so welcomed and looked after by Gabriela, Jorge and Mona's sister-in-law and de facto GM of the property. I can't even begin to express of gratitude for all the advice and help that she gave. She is friendly, warm, and has a real interest in making sure that you have what you need. OUR FIRST, BUT DEFINITELY NOT OUR LAST TIME TO THIS EXCITING CITY. MEXICO LINDO!"

The bedrooms are large, the beds are comfortable, and the four bathrooms made it easy for us to all get ready morning and night without any hassle.  Everything is very clean.  The house is very secure with a double gated courtyard, and the neighbors in the complex are friendly and quiet.  The neighborhood is very safe.\r\n\r\nGabriela, our hostess, maintained an open line of communication with us before our stay to ensure a smooth arrival.  She was there to greet us, and kindly checked in with us during our stay and made sure that everything about our stay exceeded expectations.  We could not have been more pleased with her consideration and the home.  \r\n\r\nThank you Jorge, Monnah, and Gabriela.

It was the perfect home base for our adventures, and was spacious enough for all of us. Gaby, the property manager, was very helpful when we arrived - she gave us directions to the nearest grocery store, metro stops and nearby restaurants. Rooms were extremely comfortable and had more than enough space for us to get ready without being in each other's way.\r\n\r\nWe found a fantastic empanada just around the corner and a market at Alvarado on Tuesdays. Just a few blocks away, at the corner of Murgu\u00eda and Marti, were the best tacos we had during our visit - that in itself was worth the stay! A short walk away was the fun Condesa neighborhood and Uber covered us for everything else. We had a great time and will be coming back!"

The place is very clean, well equipped, and the neighborhood is quiet and friendly. If you walk 10-15 minutes, you will be in zone (condesa) with plenty of restaurants and bars. Two big and modern TVs with cable and wifi.  The living room is excellent for sharing moments with friends or family. Three big and spacious bedrooms, each one with complete bathroom. My friends and I are really happy with this experience. No doubt we are looking forward to rent  this place again in our next trip to Ciudad de M\u00e9xico. "

We were traveling with a group of friends and not sure where we'd find space for so many, but this beautiful two story, 6-bedroom palace turned out to be perfect. We'd originally been looking in la Condesa, but though only a stone's throw away from all the restaurants and nightlife, we were much happier to be on this lovely tree-lined street in quiet Escandon, just to the south. Within blocks, we had several good metro options (minutes from downtown, or most other places we needed to reach), great taco stands, excellent coffee (Illusionista), delicious fresh pastries, and an absurdly adorable ice cream parlor (Helader\u00eda Escand\u00f3n), and a variety of corner groceries -- all tucked away in the trees and interesting mix of residential architecture. The house itself was unusually well-outfitted -- filtered water deliveries, a bathroom for every bedroom, two courtyards, roof, great common spaces to hang out in after a day out exploring the city, well-stocked kitchen, even one amazing bedroom in a library. Thanks, we couldn't have been happier."

The area is quiet, so you don't have to worry about loud noises. That said, you will most likely use Uber to travel anywhere from this location. It is in a residential area. Uber is fairly cheap, so I don't think that you will mind. The security of the home is great - multiple locked doors to go through in order to gain access. My group and I felt very safe here.\n\nI found the hosts to be very responsive and they provided plenty of advice our group. The bedrooms, bathrooms (of which there are plenty), and kitchen were all very clean and well-maintained. The common areas were the same. I'd highly recommend this home for your stay in Mexico City. While the location is not in a high-traffic part of town, every other aspect of the home is great."

The house is amazing with lots of lighting and everything you need in the kitchen if you decide to cook. 11 people stayed at this house and everyone had room for anything and what's even better is the amount of bathrooms which equal the amount of rooms in the house. Also Gabriela helped us with our food delivery order because we were having a hard time, so that was something we really appreciated. I can definitely recommend this house to anybody who wants to stay in Mexico city. "

From there I will discuss the good because credit should be given where it is deserved, and conclude with minor inconveniences. On the second day of our trip, my group and I returned to Monnah's house after spending the first half of the day at Chapultepec. Upon returning to the house, my group and I came to find the inner door of the home halfway open. My group consisted of six (6) people and we all saw the door. This was very strange so one person said, \"Hello? Is someone here?\" Immediately we all heard the kitchen door slam. I do not want to provide a layout of Monnah's home as I think that would present a safety issue, but suffice it to say, the door which slammed leads to an exit. I instructed everyone to leave the house in an attempt to preserve everyone's safety. My group and I have traveled to many Central American countries, and even Uganda, so the notion that someone would break into one's home to either steal valuables, or to collect information to later kidnap someone is not far-fetched at all. Let's be honest, kidnapping in Mexico City is not unheard of and therefore, we took this seeming intrusion very seriously. Standing in front of the home, we asked one another if anyone left the door open. I unequivocally stated \"no\" because I made a joke at one of my friends for initially exiting the home without closing the door behind her. As a result, I had to pull and lock the door prior to our departure. I called the property manager who told me she would send over the mainte0ce tech. It took the mainte0ce tech about 10 minutes to arrive, and in the meantime, the neighbors came out to ask what was going on. They were not convinced that someone could have gotten into the home because according to them it's very difficult to enter the home from where we suspect the alleged intruder had entered. Again, because this is a public review, I do not want to provide details of Monnah's house layout so I will not go in-depth about how we believe the intruder entered. When the mainte0ce tech arrived, he and two of my friends searched Monnah's home from top to bottom. I remained with the girls outside. In no time flat, both of my friends appeared from the entry point where we suspect someone may have broken into the home, and they confirmed that it would be relatively easy to access the same entry point. The mainte0ce tech also confirmed that two doors which lead to the exit point were unlocked. My friend then found his girlfriend's suitcase wide open, despite it being left closed prior to our departure that morning...."

She was always available 24 hours a day with any comments, questions, or concerns. Anyone who stays here will have no issues. There is not a doubt in my mind that Gaby can't fix anything. She was able to fix a plumbing issue right away. I want to advice any foreigner visiting Mexico.

Her responses were prompt, professional, and exceedingly helpful. After one member of our group had their luggage delayed, she offered to have it delivered to her so we didn't have to stick around the condo to wait for it. She was an indispensable part of our experience here.\n\nThe condo itself is very stylish but also functional. The second floor is accessible only by a flight of stairs. There is a closet full of various toiletry items at the top of the second floor which was also helpful. Beds were comfortable and towels were fluffy.\n\nEntry into the house was via a series of locked doors, each with their own key. This got a bit confusing at times but we appreciated the added security measures.\n\nOverall, would definitely recommend this spot for a stay for a large group in CDMX!"

There were six bedrooms, each with their own bathrooms so there was plenty of space and privacy. Each person had two towels and there was plenty of toilet paper. Gabriella was kind enough to let us check in early and check out late which was extremely helpful with our flight schedule. She also helped with local event recommendations and even called a place on our behalf to see if it was open. We really enjoyed this place and will return if we have another large group again."

We had the comforts of a tasteful home, at the same time as we had lots of  privacy.  Their dog Maya is adorable too.  Breakfast was prepared for us in the mornings, and their housekeeper was also kind enough to wash our laundry.  I would stay here again."

And the house is really lovely, better even than the photos, with a nice little garden that gets sun a few hours a day, very welcome here in this damp chilly city. The room is not huge but it is cozy and quiet and fresh and white, and feels like home, safe and secure. There is lots of storage space and a good firm mattress - Yes! There is also a  wonderful Saint Bernard if you love dogs. I hate to leave! one caveat: Paco does smoke, when he is there; I never said anything but he would probably accomodate, The bedroom is smoke free, though. And the house is well aired and cleaned every day by the adorable maid, Yolanda. So I can definitely recommend this rental!"

I can't say enough great things. Paco was there to welcome me when I arrived and had taken the trouble of printing out maps and directions for nearby attractions. He also introduced me to a friend of his who became my un-official tour guide and is now a good friend. When I had trouble finding somewhere to exchange currency, Paco was able to help out with that too. My first time in Mexico City was an incredible experience and Paco and his wife had everything to do with that. I'm extremely grateful to them. Also, the house is beautiful, clean and very comfortable. I could go on and on but you get the point! :)"

We enjoyed access to wireless that was fast and reliable. Our stay in Mexico City was enhanced by staying in a neighborhood that was close to all the important things we wanted to see: museums and Chapultepec Park. Paco's advise was always welcome - he knows everything about the City and what to do and when. Why stay anywhere else?"

They also have a delightful dog and my room and breakfast were excellent too. I'm running out of superlatives! The only negative thing for me was it was too short! Que lastima!! But the best things in life always leave you wanting more  :) so I would love to return to their fab home ASAP and to explore more of DF which I only scratched the surface of on my brief trip - I hope they come and visit me in LA so I can return their hospitality.

Paco and Maria Jose are exceptional hosts and really represent the best that airbnb can be.  The house is as depicted in the photographs: beautiful, stylish and clean.  The hospitality offered goes above and beyond, and the location is perfect for exploring the hipper parts of Mexico DF, like Colonia Condesa, which is very close and Colonia Roma which is a bit farther but still walkable.  The lovely park of Chapultepec is very nearby with museums and Polanco is also close.  We loved staying here!"

After spending 2 other trips in a hotel by the Zocolo with the hustle and bustle of the area their place was  the change we were looking for.  The photos on this site don't even come close to how beautiful a house Paco renovated with his own two hands.  I'm still surprised he could fit in such great workmanship in his off hours of being a doctor.  Although we are seasoned travellers we forgot to print a (Hidden by Airbnb) map of the area so got a bit lost finding the address.  We were pleasantly surprised to find Paco and his lovely Maya walking down the street to look for us.  He was worried we were lsot.  That showed us his true spirit of kindness.  His help in printing out area maps, giving us advice about the different areas to explore in DF and then along the southern coast were appreciated more than he will ever know.  Yolanda was so wonderful to us preparing a fantastic breakfast each morning and a cool drink in the afternoon when we showed up unexpectedly on our return journey home.  We have never met such generous people in our travels, even letting us sleep on the couch when the 2 rooms were fully booked.  We hope more will take it upon themselves to meet and stay with Paco, Marie Jose and Maya on their travels.  They are truly jewels and we look forward to staying with them again.  Please look at all of Paco's art work and photography, he is one very talented man.  Susan and Jan. Dec (Phone number hidden by Airbnb)"

The home is gorgeous and the guest room we stayed in was perfect. We were provided with a lot of great information on the surrounding areas in the neighbourhood and Mexico City in general, plus given printed maps and emergency contact info. We will be staying there again during our next visit to Mexico and highly recommend this place for a short or long stay."

They are lovely, generous, kind hearted and helpful people who go above and beyond to make their guests feel at home. We stayed there for an extended period, and felt extremely lucky to have fallen into the best house in Chapultepec. The house itself is a short lovely stroll to Condesa and Roma, very close to Metro stations and bus routes, is 2 minutes from a supermarket, and there is the lovely big Chapultepec park with museums and galleries in it. I highly recommend this place to anyone wanting a homely pad to call home when in Mexico city. I am proud to now consider them part of my International family. "

The house was spacious and well located between two bustling neighborhoods, but still in a very quiet and safe part of town.\r\n\r\nI made the booking last minute (day before) - Paco responded quickly and made himself available for our arrival.\r\n\r\nHighly recommended."

Location was safe, there were a few restaurants and supermarkets around the area. \r\n\r\nAs host, Paco and his wife were extremely helpful and very friendly.,For instance,  a prepaid cellphone was in the room in case I needed it, a card to use on the metrobus, and very much willing to answer any questions. The housekeeper was also very much willing to go out of her way to help me out, staying late waiting for me on the first day, because I arrived later than anticipated.\r\n\r\nAdd to that some very friendly (and cute) dogs, breakfast in the morning, and it's an amazing value. \r\n\r\nHighly recommended, ideal for solo business travelers or couples doing tourism. \r\n"

We awoke every morning to the sounds of children playing in the nearby daycare and a breakfast of fresh fruit, coffee, and a hot dish prepared by their housekeeper, Yolanda. We were made to feel welcome right away, and felt like we were leaving home at the end of our stay.\r\n\r\nPaco provided us with several maps of the city and a cell phone upon our arrival, as well as useful tips for getting around and a thoughtful assessment of our itinerary for the week. He was very helpful in our getting acquainted with the city and all it has to offer. Yolanda was especially friendly and generous throughout the week, cleaning our room daily (even on the weekend!) and washing and folding our laundry upon request. It was great having the company of their dogs as well, who took to us immediately and greeted us upon our return home every afternoon and evening.\r\n\r\nOverall a great experience we recommend. Paco and Maria Jose's home was a perfectly safe and comfortable hub for our first visit to the DF. We will be back."

They are both perfect hosts and the same is true for Yolanda whose attention for guests is marvellous!  I was very pleased to know them. The services offered have been mentioned and described by other guests and they were offered to me, too, of course! It was a wonderful and pleasant experience to stay at the beautiful and calm place in the very loud and busy metropolis. It is also a very nice and safe neighborhood from were you can easily access Condesa or other parts of the city by Metrobus, Metro or walking. I highly recommend this place for other people visiting D.F. and I hope for myself to get the opportunity to come back!   "

The room was incredibly cozy and Paco and Maria Jose could not have been nicer. They provided us with a cell phone and a bus transit card. The wifi was consistent and useful for (Hidden by Airbnb) communication, which I used a couple of times. Paco had great suggestions for restaurants and activities. Maria Jose was very kind and helpful. Both are very busy professionals, so we really appreciated the time that they took with us.  Yolanda was there every day to make breakfast. She also took such great care with our room. Just wonderful people."

Although we had both traveled widely around Mexico, she had never visited D. F. She had also never booked a room through Airbnb.com. \r\n\r\nWe both had a fabulous time. We took Paco's suggestion and went to Xochimilco for a boat ride, among other things. There is so much to see in Mexico City that it was good to have someone to help narrow down the possibilities. Mom loved the house, especially the two dogs. \r\n\r\nYolanda, as always, was an indispensable part of the experience. Every day, there was a new arrangement to the breakfast table or bedroom. Maria Jose was also very helpful and kind.\r\n\r\nI would recommend to anyone visiting Mexico that Airbnb, and particularly this place, is a superior choice over a hotel. I hope that we can return the hospitality some day, either in Atlanta, or Louisiana.\r\n"

For the specifics read on below (other travelers speak to many details of the hospitality and the house).  A few thoughts: the house is if anything more beautiful than the photos. San Miguel Chapultapec is a great choice as a neighborhood to stay in (especially with Maria Jose and Paco) - it's very convenient to transit (metro and metrobus); has all the conveniences you would need (e.g. supermarkets, Sanborns, restaraunts, taco stands, etc.); it's near many spots you might want to visit (Chapultapec Park, La Condesa, Roma, etc.) but is very calm and almost tranquil. If you're looking for a homestay with a wonderful Mexican family, I can't imagine finding a better option.  "

Everything from the easy directions to the house, guidance notes (they were away when I arrived) and the thoughtful birthday breakfast, complete with balloons, cake and a singing candle, they arranged for me on my first morning in Mexico. Their housekeeper Yolanda is a star, always greeting me with a smile and breakfasts designed to fattening me up. And I fell in love with their dogs who spent each night stretched outside my bedroom door. When I did meet Francisco and his wife, it was like meeting old friends. All in all they made my first trip to Mexico a wonderfully memorable experience and I can't wait to return. My advice - stop searching for a place to stay in Mexico City, this is the place, book now - you won't regret it."

They were generous hosts who loved to visit although their work schedules often meant only in the evenings and weekends. They both spoke English very well. Housekeeper Yolanda (she spoke only Spanish) prepared an excellent breakfast which always included something hot in addition to many extras. The two dogs were fun. The photographs and the description of the house on the Airbnb website are very accurate and they deserve all the positive reviews. The neighborhood was quiet save for the big jets that passed over the city but this would happen regardless of where you stay. Perhaps it was a quiet because a convent was across the street. \r\nOur hosts left the house around 7:30 to 8:00 in the morning for work and breakfast was provided around 8:30 but it could be later if you want to sleep in longer. \r\nThe house was roomy with two floors. Downstairs were the living area rooms and the kitchen. There were two upstairs rooms they rent out although they usually only rent out one at a time so they can give more attention to their guests. Occasionally a relative might stay in the other guest room. Our host's bedroom was also upstairs and they were very quiet about leaving in the mornings. \r\nWe had their approval to use the entire house including the kitchen. We did not use their TV although we had permission to do so but we did use their computer once. Paco kindly printed off our boarding passes the day before our departure. \r\nOur room included a very good double bed, extra single loft bed, sofa, desk and chair, lots of wardrobe and drawers, and a large window that overlooked their backyard. Just outside the bedroom was the bathroom and also a sitting room which we often used before retiring. Yolanda provided us with clean towels each day and tidied up our room. \r\nThis home stay was very affordable, especially considering the quality and comforts of their place and the breakfast.  The house was about a ten minute brisk walk to four different metro stations, two minutes from a metrobus stop, and other bus runs. There were also places to eat that were a short walk away, two grocery stores, and other shops. The location was also a short walk from the nice streets and restaurants in the La Condesa neighborhood and not too far away from Chapultapec Park. With a walk to the metro you were never far away from anyplace in the city.  \r\nWe loved our eight day stay with this \"Best House\" and visiting with our hosts plus it was a very affordable place to stay. There is nothing that could have improved our stay. We would certainly stay there again, partly because the place is so great and also because there is so much to see and do in Mexico City and in eight days we only scratched the surface.  \r\n"

The house is beautifully furnished and cozy and is perfectly suited to a traveling Bohemian. All the necessary creature comforts are here including nice linens, a comfortable bed, a laundry service, and a delicious warm breakfast. The unexpected and hugely welcome extra was the mobile phone the hosts provide to their guests which proves to be a life saver. Francisco and Maria Jose are also very helpful when it comes to helping the visitor gets their bearings in this tumultuous city. We got great advice on anything from memorable cultural experiences to help with taxis to the different destinations around town. The joy of AirBNB is discovering an unexpected jewel of a home in a far-away land and Francisco and Maria Jose's home is absolutely the epitome of fantastic AirBNB experience. "

They are great hosts; very caring - I have so much to say so let me put that in points :)\r\n\r\n- Well the care starts right from your initial queries about the booking because Paco will give all sorts of advice for your itinerary and other tips needed for your trip in Mexico. \r\n\r\n- We had one more friend who planned his trip later; Paco helped us with his accommodation at his friends place and his move.\r\n\r\n- The house is very big and beautiful; just as in pictures. There is a big living room which you can use and kitchen for your needs.\r\n\r\n- The breakfast that Yolanda prepares is good to kick start your day - especially the cheese omelette and fresh juice and fruits.\r\n\r\n- There are many guide books available for your stay in Mexico city; do look at the one with pictures of Mexico city - will definitely inspire you to add few more places in your itinerary.\r\n\r\n- They gave a local mobile phone to use - very handy to call taxi or call back Paco if stuck somewhere.\r\n\r\n- Paco even helped us with buying bus tickets as there was some problem buying them online - yet another way to show care for their guests.\r\n\r\nSome more things to know:\r\n\r\n- The house is connected by 2 metro stations nearby but we used taxi most of the times as it was convenient and not very expensive. Around 40-50 pesos to go to Zocalo or around if you get the right cab person.\r\n\r\n- Go to nearby Condesa area for trendy bars and restaurants for dinner.\r\n\r\n- Do take the map printout that Paco hands to you as it is helpful to tell the taxi driver where to take (especially if you don't know Spanish)"

Even though we only stayed two nights, Paco made sure to suggest the best things to do while we were there- without him we wouldn't have known about the Bike day, the last Sunday of the month, when many major streets are closed so only bikes can cruise through. He printed out maps for each area, and let us use his computer to check our email and print our boarding passes. He really cares about his guest's comfort and security. The house was lovely, quiet, clean and welcoming. Mexico city however is full of busy, almost freeway like roads, so walking to Condesa requires some skillful road crossing, or pedestrian bridge use from their house. Otherwise, highly recommended."

Moy walked with us to the nearby neighborhood of la Condesa which has beautiful tree lined streets and lots of restaurants and bars.  Paco and Maria Jose\u2019s home is a lovely escape from the busy city and is a reflection of their great taste in art and architecture.

Magically breakfast appears on the table with something for everyone including fresh fruit, cereal, yogurt, cake, bread, coffee and juices. She even does your laundry! Leave a nice tip. \r\n\r\nThere is a market/grocery store 2 blocks away as you are welcome to use the kitchen and entire home. The location is great for Chapultepec Park (walk through, go to the Museuam of Anthropology, The Castle and out onto La Reforma and the Angel of Independence). Great for Polanco and Condesa areas and even Zona Rosa as taxi's are very cheap however; YOU MUST HAVE A GPS or MAP (my Garmin was invaluable - and free) of where you want to go. There are 250,000 taxi driver's and none know the whole city. This house was very difficult for them to find so we often just walked in from the market on the main st. If you have your GPS (phone or other) you can also track the taxi as you ride along. Use the taxi service number that Paco gives you. But be ready. They show up immediately. \r\n\r\nThe dogs are very well behaved but my friend had allergies so...\r\n\r\nMexico City was not as warm as I had originally thought as it is 2500m above sea level. The homes are not heated and sometimes it was cool as it was also rainy season.\r\n\r\nThe altitude 'sickness' hit this fit West Coast girl hard as far as climbing stairs; short of breath and light headedness.\r\n\r\nEat at Nu Trete, Maria's favorite and mine too. The bar across the street from there has excellent music and vibe at night. \r\n\r\nJune 2013 - 6 nights "

From their house, their warmth and tremendous hospitality and commitment to make you feel right at home.\r\nFrom the very first moment we arrived, Maria Jose personally took us for a walk around the neighborhood (by the way, great location, conveniently connected to all major points in the city), to make sure we knew where everything was and how to get to the metro and bus stations - she took us for this walkabout even as she had clearly just arrived home from a long day at work!\r\n\r\nYolanda, the housekeeper was also fantastic!! She helped us with our suitcases and had a fresh breakfast ready for us in the morning. \r\nPaco greeted us at night, after we came back from dinner, and made sure we had everything we needed in our room, including fresh linens, bottled water, and instructions on how to lock the house with our own set of keys.\r\nAside all these, which falls within what we already knew about them through the reviews, what impacted us most about them was the fact that even after our sudden change in plans, they made sure we were OK, and kept in touch with us by letting us keep their cellphone. \r\nOverall, the only thing I regret from this experience, is not being able to stay with them longer!! We truly recommend them. :)"

I stayed for 2 weeks and enjoyed every minute of it. \r\nA very comfortable bed, fresh fruit every morning, interesting conversations with Paco who knows so much about art and museums and the amazing care of Yolanda made me feel at home away from home. A wonderful place in a very safe and quiet area but close to public transport, Chapultepec and Condesa, that will exceed your expectations. Highly recommended, the best choice for your stay in Mexico City."

Actually it was a really cool experience because we really felt like in our house: we enjoyed a delicious breakfast every morning and meals in the large garden.\r\nI definitely recommend their home if you think about going to Mexico City, you will have a very comfortable bed to rest after a long walk, you can cook something in the beautiful kitchen (or just eat \"tlayudas\" and \"quesadillas\" in a place two blocks away!). It's well connected to nearby metro stations and only blocks away to metrobus.\r\n\r\nWe really enjoyed our time at Maria and Pacos's houes!"

Just a few blocks away is an amazing restaurant called La Poblanita, serving traditional cuisine from Puebla and Yucatan.  The mole and cochinita pibil were to die for, and inexpensive. \r\nThank you Francisco, Maria, y Yolanda for everything, and I hope we meet again soon.   Muchas Gracias!"

It's clear from the moment you step in that their home is maintained very well, and that they are invested in making their guests feel welcomed and secure in Mexico City. The neighborhood is quiet and lovely, with a few good local spots to eat. They are right under Bosque Chapultepec, and the 7 Metro line at Constituyentes (I would avoid going to  the Tacubaya stop- can be very confusing). \r\n\r\nI would say that if you are looking for a quiet, centralized place to have as a homebase to explore DF from, Paco and Maria Jose's place is very hard to beat- value, location, warm and helpful hosts, safety- absolutely nothing not to like. Praise all around.      "

The house is very quiet, located just a bit down from a main street, so once you get your bearings, always very easy to find.

I would urge future guests to immediately experience the Condessa neighborhood, a 20 peso ride away, and filled with small restaurants, stores, lots of green, and a great place to walk and watch others walk their dogs. If you are too tired after a great day in Mexico, walk out of the house to the right, turn left for 1 block, and cross the street to a terrific street vendor halfway down on the other side that made wonderful hot and healthy chicken dishes to eat at his stand or carry home.

As this was our first trip to Mexico and we speak only ten words of Spanish we needed some \"hand holding\" at the beginning.  We were walked to the subway (metro) station, shown how to buy tickets, how to navigate, loaned a cell phone just in case, and then never looked back.  We were subsequently able to travel all over town to different places and back at all hours and thus make the most of our eight day stay.  Our hosts also made sure safe and reasonable taxis showed up for other trips and the airport.\r\n\r\nBreakfasts were a pleasant buffet of cereal, fruit, yoghurt, coffee and tea and available until 11:00 a.m. for the jet-lagged.  \r\n\r\nAlthough we are not normally fans of dogs in the house these two were friendly to guests and so well cared-for there was not a dog hair in sight.  They also added to the sense of security to the place.\r\n\r\nIt was also very nice of our relaxed hosts to invite their guests into other parts of the house so that we never felt constrained to the bedroom, comfortable as it  common was.\r\n\r\nThank you Francisco and Maria Jose and Maya plus small friend and also the pleasant house staff.  We would definitely like to come back."

We were debating between staying at a hotel or in this house and I am very glad that we chose to stay here and next time we are in Mexico City, my wife and I will stay in the same place.\r\nHere are a few reasons:\r\n1. The location is excellent.  Great neighborhood, strategically located for easy access to the metro, transportation and the city's most interesting places.\r\n2. Accommodations are fantastic.  The bed was great, the rooms and bathrooms were clean and maintained daily and every morning breakfast was waiting for us.  Great value for the money.\r\n3. Hosts were fantastic.  Communication before we arrived was consistent, clear and timely and they were able to work with our fluid schedule.  After we arrived, Paco made sure that our stay went as well as possible and spent time to sit with us and explain the city and give us the basics to get all out of our stay in Mexico.\r\n4. The extra touches like having a cell phone waiting for us to use, contacts with reliable taxi drivers, maps available to us and restaurant recommendations really made our stay.  We could not have had this sort of personalized service at a hotel.\r\n\r\nI strongly recommend staying here. "

Their home is as lovely as it appears in the photos and is located in a charming residential area not far from most of the districts that visitors would be likely to visit.  The most special aspect of the stay was the help Paco provided in giving us recommendations, advice and assistance from the beginning to the end of our trip. He really went above and beyond to make sure that we had a great trip in Mexico City and a comfortable stay in his and Maria Jose's home, and we are so grateful for this.  I will definitely stay with Paco and Maria Jose again and recommend this house to any prospective travellers without any hesitation. This was probably my best airbnb experience so far. "

Upon our arrival in the D.F. we stayed in an apartment in the Centro Hist\u00f3rico (because Paco and Maria's was not available those days), and I can say without a doubt that our apartment experience does not compare to that of San Miguel. Staying with natives of the DF will always provide a superior trip to Mexico if those natives are as kind as easy to relate to as Paco and Maria. My husband and three children shared two rooms over our stay. My husband stayed a week and my children (age 10, 13, and nearly 15) and I stayed approximately 3 weeks. This house is located in a nice, quiet, safe, convenient neighborhood. It is close to Chapultepec Park, a huge grocery store (that has just about anything), several metro stops, and many restaurants. The space and home are expansive and beautiful as shown in the pictures. We never felt cramped in this space, in fact, it felt much roomier than our own home. I can tell you that by the end of the stay, the neighborhood and the house felt like home to us, and the dogs (Maya and Copit) felt like our own. That was largely due to our warm, generous, caring hosts. Paco and Maria were more than generous with the use of the house, the refrigerator, their movies (ha), and their time. They gave us a cell phone, answered any question, and helped us in every necessary instance. It is clear that they wanted us to have the best of possible stays, and in fact we did. The stay felt relaxed, allowing us our independence, while providing safety and support whenever we needed it. I really could not imagine a better place to stay in Mexico City. Paco and Maria are a lovely couple that we really enjoyed getting to know over several weeks. They are intelligent, funny, patient, down-to-earth, and genuinely great hosts. To be honest we were all sad to say goodbye to them and we will miss them here in Chicago. If you are looking for a place that feels like home away from home, you have found it. \u00a1Much\u00edsimas gracias por todo Paco and Maria!"

However, they have a \"make yourself at home\" attitude and it worked out great.  They provided a cell phone, a great map, keys, etc. to help us out during our stay.  The dogs were always well behaved and became our friends by the end of our stay who always greeted us when we came home.  The breakfast is simple but delicious and a great way to start your day.  The location is great, walking distance to the main park and to some great food areas.  I never felt unsafe, day or not, near there place (or anywhere else really).   Four of us went, we are all very easy going and it was nice to have a set of easy going homeowners as well.  Everything stated on the listing is what you get, if we venture back to Mexico City I wouldn't hesitate to stay with Paco and Maria Jose again.  Thanks for everything!"

All this made our stay in Mexico City much easier and more enjoyable.\r\nThe house has three stories: the ground floor, which includes the common rooms (kitchen, dining, living) and a nice backyard with a patio table; the second floor, where there are three guest rooms (large master with its own bathroom, two smaller bedrooms, and a shared bath). Paco and Maria stay on the third floor. They have two friendly dogs--one a big Saint Bernard, which mostly stay downstairs. The location is in a quiet neighborhood south of the Bosque de Chapultepec, walking distance to the park and its museums, and the adjacent neighborhood of Condessa and some really excellent restaurants on Avenida Michoacan. Paco and Maria provide a nice breakfast (fruit, toast, cereal, yogurt, etc.) every morning. This house was a great home base during our visit and a provided a welcome respite from commotion of one of the world's biggest cities."

In my message to Paco I motioned I was interested in renting his house and I did not understand we were going to be sharing the house with other guests or the owners . I am always very careful in accurately disclosing the number of people in the party and the arrival and departure times in order to align expectations and corresponding costs with the owner. In my experience renting large whole places, the owner has locked those rooms that will not be used and only leave available the corresponding ones so when Paco confirmed the rooms that would be made available I thought this was also going to be the case. In the end it all worked out perfectly besides this misunderstanding. Paco was very accommodating to our requests for information, needs such as parking space, towels, cradle for our daughter etc. The pictures on their add represented accurately what the house looked like (awesome place). Even the dogs were in the picture and they happened to be the mellower lovelier pets we have come across, absolutely fantastic for us since we happen to love dogs. The house was undergoing general improvement works and there were construction workers and material but none of that got in the way or had a negative impact. It is always nice to see that a plaice is being properly maintained.  I was able to communicate with Paco via Watsapp for any questions. I casually met him and his lovely wife a couple of times in the kitchen and had a very pleasant chat with them always. I would deffinately recommend it to my friends and would most certainly consider staying again with Paco and Maria Jose. I am thankful to Paco and Maria Jose for having us and wish them the best of luck as hosts of their beautiful home. "

The house itself is situated in a desirable location of the city and very close to Chapultepec Park, there was plenty of amenities nearby and it was very safe to walk around. \r\n\r\nThe house itself is as nice and welcoming as pictured they do go out of their way to make visitors from all over the world comfortable in the house. This included the nice artwork within the house and of course the dogs as pictured, others have mentioned are very well trained and simple great to be around and this is coming from a cat person.  The hosts were out of town for the most part during my stay but all provisions were well looked after. This included the service of the maids who are kind and very useful around the house. In the mornings whilst they are around breakfast is laid out to fuel your day of travel. \r\n\r\nI would most certainly visit this enchanting house again if in the city."

They have a private attached room with a separate entrance. Paco was extremely helpful with suggestions to make our stay in Mexico City even better than planned. They made us feel welcome in their home right from the beginning. They provided us local mobile phones, which we didn't need but was thoughtful. Their two dogs have the run of the house and they're so sweet -- Maya, the St. Bernard, even slept in one of our rooms all weekend.\r\n\r\nThe house is very large, was very clean, and is situated in a very quiet neighborhood just south of Chapulapec Park. It's a short walk to the park and it's near 4 metro stations.  If we weren't walking, we mostly used Uber, however, because it was so convenient and a relatively cheap way to get around town (plus, it avoids having to bargain with and feel ripped off by taxi drivers.)  Paco and Maria provided continental breakfast for us every morning, which we didn't expect but was a nice touch.  \r\n\r\nIn short, if you have a lot of people and you want a quiet place to retreat to, this is a great spot.  We had 8 people in the house, which was very comfortable at 2 adults per room, but the house sleeps quite a few more, if you're okay with being cozy (3-4 per room.) We would definitely like to rent the house again on future visits.\r\n"

There is a beautiful garden in the house, so visitors can lie in the chairs and relax themselves. Every morning, we can have breakfast in the kitchen, and when the owners of the house noticed that the basket of apples was nearly empty, they brought a big bag of apples in the evening. Besides, the owners also led us a mobile phone with local Mexican number, so we can communicate with the taxi drivers or the owners conveniently. Our room is cleaned every day, and living here is like living in a luxurious hotel. Actually, the best part of our experience is that the owners of the house are so nice! One day, we saw a ballet show and it was nearly 10 pm, the owners waited us outside the theater and drove us to the house. When we asked them to recommend us the scenes, they gave us the map and helped us connect with the taxi driver. The driver is also great, and he accompanied us all day long, and the price is relatively cheaper than those normally. When we visited in the pyramid, the driver waited us outside for four hours. The dogs in the house are really cute, and they always sleep quietly on the stairs. In conclusion, I definitely recommend this house and I will live there again if I visit Mexico in the future! p(#\u00af\u25bd\u00af#)o "

My brother and our friends stayed here for a long weekend in July, all of us visiting Mexico City for the first time. Paco sat down with us on the first night and gave us detailed recommendations and directions for sights and food. We walked easily from the house to Chapultepec, Condesa, and Roma. He also put us in touch with his friend who drove us to Teotihuacan one morning. The comforts of the house added so much to our stay, and we can't wait to be back. Gracias para todo, Paco y Maria. "

Paco and Maria Jose were welcoming, gracious, and informative hosts. Breakfasts were tasty and the location was perfect for accessing galleries and museums in the areas we were concerned with. They conveniently arranged a local mobile phone for use during our stay, airport pickup, and a ride to Teotihuacan on the day we departed. My only complaint is that we had to come back to the states! Would have loved to stay longer in this wonderful place.  Thanks Paco and Maria Jose! We'll be back."

The area is safe and convenient.  If I return to Mexico City I would definitely stay here again.  They get 5 stars from me.    They even provided a cell phone for us to use while in the city.  Very handy to have a phone as we needed to call our driver to pick us up during our tours of the city.  Don't hesitate to stay here, you won't be disappointed.  If you do stay here and you don't feel like heading out too far for dinner you should try La Poblanita de Tacobaya.  Take a left as you exit the house then take your 1st left at the corner and head down 2 blocks.  Restaurant is on your left.  Very good food.  Also, there's a very good burger place directly across from La Poblanita.  The Bayou.  Kind of a hipster small burger joint.  Let me tell you, I think I had one of the best burgers I ever had there.  We ate there one night as La Poblanita closed at 7pm.  Thank you Paco and Maria for providing an awesome place to stay.  I hope to see you guys again.\r\n\r\nRich"

Unfortunately, our hosts were out of town during our stay though the caretaker and maids made us feel very welcome as did their two great dogs. \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood was very quaint, quiet, and residential, and we felt plenty safe walking around (except the route to the Tacubaya Metro stop felt less comfortable). It is relatively close to neighborhoods with more \"action\" at about a 15-20 minute walk or 5 minute Uber ride. Here is where this host lost some points in our book:\r\n- We were unaware that they would not be at the house during our stay, although they were quick to communicate via the Air BNB app regarding any concerns. Still would have liked to meet them though. \r\n- The wi-fi would not work in our 3rd story room. \r\n- The shower water-pressure was basically non-existent.\r\n- No heat or A/C in our room.\r\n- The outdoor spiral staircase to our room was unexpected.\r\n \r\nI like to think things would have been a bit more smooth had they been home during our stay, though our complaints are minor and we had an incredible trip to D.F!"

How does it get better? You have the comfort of being in a space where you feel comfortable and at home. The location was very convenient to get around the rest of the city. Plus, they have the most wonderful dogs, so if you have to leave your own four legged friends at home, they make great substitute companions. When traveling to Mexico City, you must stay here. I would consider Paco & Maria Jose friends and look forward to visiting them again in the future. My boyfriend and I even get engaged on this trip and they left us roses and champagne in our room!

My son was quite sick when we arrived and Paco welcomed us and helped care for him. I felt at ease and grateful to be met with such care. The house was exactly as pictured, beautiful and warm with two sweet dogs to make us feel at home.The weather was unusually cold and rainy and Paco provided us with a space heater since there is no heat. He welcomed us with all the info we needed, maps, restaurant recommendations, and directions to local grocery and atm. Breakfast was generous and made available bright and early, and we had clean sheets every day!\r\nPaco and Marie Jose are lovely and gracious hosts with a fabulous home  in a great location. They made every effort to make sure we were happy and had everything we needed. I hope to return again someday. I highly recommend this home!"

Our flight landed early that morning, and they sent a driver, Gabriel, to pick up us and drop off our bags while our room was set up. Paco greeted us and handed us a local cell phone as well as a break-down of suggestions to do in the city each day. We would have honestly been lost without these two. San Miguel Chapultepec is such a beautiful part of the city, so close to the enormous Bosque with wonderful museums. You could walk about a mile east and check out the row of restaurants and bars in Condesa. We got to use the bike system to ride down to the Historic District with no issues. Maria arranged for us to get to Teotihuacan to check out the pyramids for an additional cost. Their two dogs are so sweet, we gave them many hugs and kisses. We managed to navigate our way to Coyoacan as well, and there are metro stations close-by their home to hop on and ride away. We made our way around Mexico City on foot with no issues, because of the advice that these two gave us. Their home is beautiful and artsy, and the room up the spiral staircase was comfortable, clean and private with a patio and hammock (!) however it was very bright in the morning, so pack a sleeping mask if you don't want the sunlight to wake you! A light breakfast is offered, juice, coffee, cereal and fruit, which was very nice. By the time we got back to the house, our room was cleaned and the bed was made, so that was a nice perk. Everyone else that stayed in the home seemed to respect each other and the common areas were kept clean. Paco and Maria are genuine and helpful and I'm glad to have met them! Our stay with them made our trip to Mexico City perfect, and if we head back, I will be sure to stay with them again. THANK YOU!!"

Their house is very big and tastefully decorated. I personally think it's a very secure house. I have no complain what so ever with my room. It was very cosy, and the bed was very comfortable. They provide cold breakfast in the kitchen in the morning. They set everything up very nicely on their grand dining table. O yeah, they also have maid cleaning my room every day. But what makes the stay much more pleasant is their two four-legged pets. Two very adorable dogs (a St Bernard and a small dog). They greeted me as soon as I walked in to the house, after a long day exploring the city. It was very comforting and it made me feel right at home.\r\nSo for all travellers out there, I highly recommend staying with Paco and Maria for your next trip to Mexico City. You won't be disappointed."

Given we were travelling for a wedding, we were a large group and thought it would be most enjoyable to be able to stay in a more home-like setting \u2013 fortunately Maria and Paco were willing to host our large group, so we booked our first Airbnb accommodation ever. \r\n\r\nRight from the time we booked online Maria and Paco were very responsive and helpful. Anytime we had a question it was answered almost immediately. Their flexible check-in time meant no waiting around after our flight and we were able to settle in right away. The house itself is beautiful and allowed us to spend evenings together as a family. As an added bonus, Maria and Paco\u2019s housekeeper Justina was kind enough to wash our clothes, make beds, and clean the dishes so we could just focus on enjoying our time in Mexico City \u2013 I only hope we didn\u2019t keep her too busy. \r\n\r\n The surrounding neighbourhood had everything we needed in close proximity \u2013 restaurants, cafes, supermarket, subway stations \u2013 and was within walking distance to what was the most important attraction for our family with young children: Chapultapec Park. We were fortunate to have new in-laws in Mexico City to give us advice and help us to navigate, but Paco was quick to provide advice and assistance whenever requested. I would recommend Paco and Maria as hosts should anyone I know travel to Mexico City. Thank you Paco and Maria. \r\n"

We were a large group, and prior to our arrival Paco and Maria walked me through every aspect of our stay, from airport pickups, to pyramid trips, to dinners, which was fantastic! They have a beautiful home, better than the pictures! And everything about the stay in the house was perfect. Paco and Maria really go out of their way to make sure that you enjoy your stay in their house and Mexico City. You have everything you need. I will be staying with them on my future trips back to Mexico City, it felt like a home away from home.  "

The best thing about staying with Maria and Paco, however, was their attentiveness and help in finding what we needed. We highly recommend their home for an enjoyable visit to Mexico City, and we look forward to returning!"

Had a lot of fun with the two lovely dogs which we will miss a lot. A few minutes walk get you to a supermarket and restaurants. 10-15 minutes get you to some very trendy restaurants.\nBoth Maria and Francisco speak excellent English. Maria gave us a warm welcome and clear instructions of directions. They gave us a mobile phone which meant much convenience. Our laundry was also done during house cleaning. We used the car service to and from the airport and to do a day trip to see the pyramids. Their driver, Gabrielle, was polite. Overall an excellent stay. Will surely choose this place again if we visit Mexico City again."

They are beautiful, private, comfortable, and close to some of the best areas in Mexico City - restaurants, parks, museums, anything you may want.  They also offer a driver, Gabriel who was terrific - so convenient and so affordable.  With 15 of us, we were so grateful to have his services.  \nAs mentioned, we stayed in 2 homes and they are both wonderful but very different.  The mansion is the original home in the area and is truer to its long history in terms of furnishings and decor.  The other has been totally redone and is more modern - choose the one that best suits your aesthetic.  \0d one cannot review these homes without mentioning the help and attentiveness of our hosts, Francisco & Maria.  They are a wealth of information about the city, its attractions, restaurants, markets and shopping.\nYou would be very lucky to have the opportunity to stay at one of their airbnbs."

This was my first time using Airbnb and my family was a little hesitant at first (there were 8 of us total), but by the end of our trip we had fallen in love with both the city and this house. The pictures that are posted really don't do the house justice. The facade of the house and the street leading up to it aren't particularly impressive, but the moment the gate opens up you are greeted not only by an absolutely beautiful 3 story home, but also by his awesome dogs. The house is very spacious with more than enough room for a large family plus friends. Francisco and his family live on the property, but in separate living quarters. This means that you might see them once in a while and if you have any issues they're always right there to help with anything you need. \n\nFrancisco himself was an incredible host. Even before our trip he was always responded promptly to my messages. He offered to send his driver pick us up from the airport, all 8 of us, which was great. Once we arrived at his home, he gave us a tour of the property and then sat us all down and showed us on a map where the house was in relation of all of the important spots in Mexico City. We saw him almost everyday and he always asked how everything was going and if we needed anything. If you choose to have him pick you up you'll also meet his driver Gabriel. We wanted to visit the pyramids of Teotihuacan and a few other spots, so Gabriel offered to rent a large van and drive all of use around the entire day! It was so much better than paying a tour company. \n\nThe location of the house is also very good. We walked to the Castle of Chapultepec (El castillo de chapultepec) and el museo de antropologia. For anything else, a quick and inexpensive Uber ride will get you where you need to go.  Overall, we had an amazing time in Mexico City and I'm glad I decided to stay in Francisco's home. I would recommend this place to all of my family and friends."

Francisco couldn't have been more helpful.....and Maria Jose had just had a baby!  Everything was better than expected, everyone was very happy and they even let Maya (the huge St. Bernard) stay in my room....helped me as I missed my pups so very much.  towards the end of our stay the smaller dog (forgot name) warmed up to me as well.  We were surprised that the family is in the house as we thought they were in a separate \"in-law suite\" in the back of the property....or something.  In fact, the house is shared, hard to explain but they have their own suite of rooms within the house.  It was never an issue and we all very much enjoyed our stay.  The rooms and bathrooms were amazing and we had daily maid service.  I found the bed to be on the hard side but travel with my foam pad so it wasn't a problem.  Francisco explained that firmer meant better quality....  The rooms that were upstairs that had a small terrace were where some of my family stayed and they were so very happy with their rooms...again, only complaint were the firm beds.  I figured out how to get Netflix -loved the selection.  I know I'm always leery of a \"perfect\" (Website hidden by Airbnb) if there was one (Website hidden by Airbnb) had to be that all the doors and some windows were always open which was great except that in Mexico, there are no screens on the windows (anywhere) and usually it's not an issue but with climate change or whatever....the mosquitoes ate a few of us up.  NOT a fault of Francisco, just the only issue I had with our whole stay.  On our last night, I mentioned this to Francisco and he said he could have done something about it....I should have spoken up as they were the most accommodating hosts in every way.   The house is gorgeous and Francisco and Maria Jose are SUPER wonderful and very accommodating.  The neighborhood is super safe, I walked around on my own and with my boys at all hours and were always met with warm smiles.  There is a small neighborhood store that is open late and an ice cream place just close by in the neighborhood but you are very near a major road with an Oxxo, (like a 7-11) Pizza place,(really good pizza but slow service) restaurant (great service and good food) and two pharmacies all within walking distance. We-All 6 of us felt like we had been staying with family by the end and no one wanted to leave.  We all want to go back and will definitely stay with Francisco Carlos and his family if they will have us.  You can't go wrong, Francisco set us up with airport transport (Gabriel) and a very patient and friendly driver (Alberto).  They were both (Website hidden by Airbnb) don't hesitate, this place has it all and then some."

Francisco has a wonderful family and a really special home \u2014 he helped us coordinate our visit, reviewed our itinerary and offered helpful suggestions, and was overall a gracious and kind host. The home itself is in a small, quiet neighborhood that's centrally located with easy access to Roma Norte / Condesa as well as Bosque de Chapultepec. Our large group had no problems navigating the neighborhood. The home itself is beautiful \u2014 clean and comfortable and decorated with a remarkable art collection. Overall a really great experience. I highly recommend this Airbnb!"

They are wonderfully gracious people and welcomed six of us to their Mexico City home with amenities like a private ride into town from the airport, a driver to Teotihuacan and they even ordered tickets for us to the Frida Kahlo house when we couldn't buy them online outside of Mexico. \n\nThe house itself is beautiful and spacious. There are enough beds to comfortably sleep a ton of people and each room feels very private. The kitchen and patio make it easy to enjoy easy breakfasts in the morning and beers at night. Best of all, the two dogs (especially the St. Bernard) are eager to hang out with you. The home is walking distance from Condesa and Chapultepec park, which makes it easy to explore.\n\nI cannot recommend their home enough."

He arranged for his excellent driver, Gabriel, to handle airport transportation, as well as take us to the pyramids at Teotihuacan. And when we arrived, Francisco sat down with us and a map, and gave us detailed directions and advice on how to spend our time in Mexico City.\n\0d the place is incredible. It's situated on a quiet side street, facing a private courtyard (you share it and, occasionally, the kitchen with Francisco's lovely family, who live in an adjacent apartment, but were gone most of the time we were there). It's three stories, has been creatively renovated by Francisco himself, and includes a couple of spiral staircases, great decor, and a third-floor deck that I already miss. As a family of four, we didn't even use the second floor rooms. The two dogs are wonderful; even my wife, who's not exactly a dog person, got attached to Cupito and Maya.\n\nOh, and daily maid service is included (which I don't believe the listing states). \n\nWe loved Mexico City and wish we'd stayed longer. If we go back--and we certainly hope so--we'd love to stay at Francisco's place again."

The house is amazing - great artwork, furniture that Francisco has made, large common spaces where we could relax.

We were a party of 6 and had almost too much room. Lol!! The house is decorated beautifully and is very clean. There is a housekeeper there everyday to clean and upkeep the house. She is sweet and unobtrusive. We had her make breakfast for us one day for a fee of $35USD for the 6 of us. We asked for chilaquiles. They were the best with homemade refried beans!!! My sister in law couldn\u2019t stop saying how amazing they were!! We did opt to have someone pick us up at the airport in their Suburban. It cost $35USD one way from the airport. An UBER probably would\u2019ve been cheaper but it was nice having us all together in one vehicle. The location of the house is good. It\u2019s too far from Downtown to walk but UBER is easy and cheap to use. There are many restaurants and grocery stores near by the house to eat if you don\u2019t want to go all the way downtown. I would definitely recommend this place if you are spending some days in Mexico City."

Great communication with our hosts throughout it all. They are attentive to our needs and the house staff was also accommodating and great. The house is basically a huge house divided with living headquarters for the hosts and the other half for guests. Plenty of bathrooms, rooms, couches, sitting areas, and beds for large groups. We were a group of 8 and it was perfect: 2 people per room. Two of the rooms are separated from the main house, meaning that you have to go outside and walk up stairs to get to them. Those two separate rooms have a private balcony with some chairs outside. The two other rooms are in the main house upstairs. The house comes with a cleaning lady whom I did not meet but appreciated how amazing our room was after coming home. Gabriel is the driver and he charges separately for day trips anywhere. We used his service for Teotihuac\u00e1n and it was perfect since he then took us to Coyoac\u00e1n after. We also used him for Xochimilco but in all honesty, we could have taken an Uber. Karina is the chef and she can cook you something for a small fee per person. The dogs (Maya & Copito) are just adorable and so loveable. I truly recommended this place for large groups."

It is an incredible space in a great, safe location. We were a group of 6 girls and a special feature of the house is that you really don't know if other people are awake, showering, talking, etc. due to the room layout (which is really nice when people are on different sleep schedules). Francisco was a very welcoming, easy host and helped all of us get settled, provided recommendations, etc.  The daily housekeeping was an added bonus -- it was nice to have a clean room to come back to after a day of exploring the city.  I hope to come back and stay here again."

I say estate because it is truly grand; the decor is beautiful, the art is one of a kind, and the space is very, very large. There were 10 of us staying there for a weekend and we had plenty of private and public areas. There are multiple bathrooms and we never had trouble showering or getting ready. The house is walking distance to several attractions in Condesa/Roma, or a very quick $2-3 USD uber ride to Polanco or Centro HIstorico. The home is behind a large gate with a door code so we never felt unsafe. It is a very private, quiet, pretty neighborhood. The BEST THING about this airbnb is that Francisco & Maria are EXTREMELY quick to respond and help you coordinate our trip. This was invaluable to us because we were coming from abroad. Just a heads up that the airbnb does include their two pet dogs - they are both very well trained and good mannered, but we did not realize that they would be in the airbnb. None of us had any problems with the dogs, but FYI for those of you who are allergic."

We especially enjoyed drinking our morning coffee on the upstairs terrace. Francisco went above and beyond to help ensure we had a great stay. We had breakfast cooked for the group one morning which was delicious and Gabriel the driver made the day trip to the Pyramids easy and convenient. The house is in a nice area and an easy Uber ride away to some of the other parts of the city we explored during our stay. I would highly recommend this place for anyone traveling with a large group. Also we never felt unsafe, the house is on a quite street behind a locked gate."

We had an excellent experience and I would definitely recommend staying here.\n\nThe family has a small staff of people who take care of the house so the house was always very clean and beds got made on a daily basis which was way beyond expectation for me. \n\nThe house is very beautiful, unique, and pretty quirky. There is art all over the house and the third story if the house is accessed through spiral staircases. It was definitely an interesting house in the best way possible.\n\nFrancisco was very helpful on the first day and gave us a map with good tips for things to do. Beyond that we didn't see much of the family, even though they do share a portion of the house. We never felt weird or awkward with them living close with a shared entrance.\n\nThe house is probably more than 3500 square feet on a gut estimate. It's a very big house. \n\nAgain, stay here if you are in Mexico City. It's a nice location and a beautiful house."

Their cook made us a couple of delicious breakfasts for a very moderate amount of money. \nA couple of things to note - there are security surveillance cameras in common areas which was a bit odd for our privacy. Also, the 2 bedrooms on the 3D level are reachable only by outdoors spiral staircases.  There is a wonderful roof terrace between these rooms.  \nOverall, we found this to be an excellent and reasonably priced property."

There is one self-contained bed-room for the guest. He keeps house neat and clean though he lives alone, which is very good trait on his part.\r\nHe seems a little casual in his life. He has yet not updated his Cell number on the Airbnb and I had a tough time getting in touch with him for the first time before my visit. But once I was able to have his contact details, he was extremely prompt in his response. I will certainly look forward to stay with him again. "

Carlos floor is not like the photos, its better!\r\n\r\nIn a secure area with all basic needs, restaurants, coffee shops and some entertainment centers, just few minutes walking from the floor. At night the area is quiet, so you can rest easily.\r\n\r\nIts always clean, tidy, and with positive vibe that is a very good value added. The guest bedroom clean for us, with private bathroom, and all the necesities you need. \r\n\r\nDefinitely if you want a better experience staying in Mexico, do not hesitate to stay at Carlos floor, he will give you the best advices about Mexico City.\r\n\r\nThe next time im going to Mexico, im sure where im going to stay for sure!\r\n\r\nCheers!"

Carlos as a host is incredible! He is super laid back and incredibly friendly. If you plan on staying more than a few days (like I did) he definitely makes you feel like the place is your own and you can really settle in. He knows the area incredibly well, has tons of great suggestions, and is very attentive if there is anything you need. The space itself is in a great location within close walking distance to shopping, restaurants, super market, movie theater, and the metro station. The room was comfortable and clean and includes lots of storage (drawers, closet, etc) and a private bathroom. The common areas are always clean and incredibly spacious. Also, if you can't live without WiFi Carlos has you covered. It's fast and reliable and the one day it was out I let Carlos know and he responded and had it fixed in a matter of minutes. You really can't go wrong with this amazing host, great room, and convenient location! "

Rosy, Alberto y las chicas de cocina me atendieron muy bien, me hicieron sentir como en casa. La comida muy rica por cierto.\n\nEl hotel est\u00e1 en un muy buen punto, enfrente puedes tomar el metrobus, a cuatro cuadras est\u00e1 la estaci\u00f3n del metro, a unas 6 cuadras tienes el Parque M\u00e9xico y como a 7 el coraz\u00f3n de la condesa. La casa est\u00e1 en muy buenas condiciones, la limpieza de los cuartos y \u00e1reas comunes bastante bien.\n\nLo recomend\u00e9 a toda mi familia y amigos. Pienso volver cada vez que vaya al DF."

The place is located few blocks away from the Independence Angel in Reforma avenue with lots of restaurants and bars in the area. As an old building, the apartment has some mainte0ce problems like the lack of hot water in the shower and the shower drain pipe doesn't work well. This could be uncomfortable If you are staying for several days. To enhance the experience, I recommend to listen to 70's music while there."

All bad things could've gone away if he had the cordiality to take things into matter in a more professional way, but he didn't. Overall experience, bad bad bad. Disappointing with a good location and great possibilities if they care about important details and stuff like mainte0ce and some customer support."

The majority of the apartment is one large open floor plan that feels like something straight out of an Austin Powers movie. It has orange shag carpeting, floor to ceiling paneling with built in custom furniture, and oddly around 20 phones in the space! The apartment is a masterpiece of 70's woodwork, with endless small details such as built in light switches, doors that close without a frame to basically disappear, and marble fixtures in the bathroom. That said, while the apartment was clearly vibrant at one time in the past, it currently feels a bit tired. Fixtures seem to be breaking, one bathroom doesn't work, the small bedroom doesn't have curtains and seems to be filled with old, non functioning equipment such as a TV and hot water heater. If it weren't for how wild the space was, we would have been disappointed by the upkeep. On the whole, I feel the apartment was a decent value, and it is centrally located. But given the current mainte0ce of the space, I don't know that I could see myself staying there again."

The built in cabinets, the tulip table, the Bertoia chairs -- all of this stuff is original and really, really beautiful. I was here for 2 weeks, and the place began to feel like home. It's a huge space, and definitely one of the most unique airbnb's I've ever been in. Roberto was as helpful as he could possibly be. When the internet wasn't quite as fast as I needed it to be (I work in software development), he immediately called to have the bandwidth increased. When I locked myself out of the apartment, he was there in 10 minutes with the keys. This airbnb is exactly what I'm looking for when I go to DF.  I'll certainly be coming back here to stay."

The location is very central to many areas though the neighborhood itself is not the most beautiful in CDMX.  The building  - actually a small office building that the original owner, Roberto's uncle helped build - could use some TLC but the apartment is very special.

Condesa was a perfect home base for us- lots to do in the neighborhood and adjoining neighborhoods nearby with a walk or even quicker taxi ride.  Great coffee at Cielito Querido right around the corner. Flat was as described, and was perfect for our family of four (2 adults, two kids, 6 and 3) with room for two or so more.\r\nOne thing I would point out, is that this is a rental, not a residence, and as such, kitchen is not as fully stocked as it would be if someone lived there at least part time.  No cork screw, for example!  We should have brought one, but we got by.\r\nAlso, tiny amenities like a bar of soap in the bathroom would have been nice.   Maybe a lit of a few local recommendations (shops, restaurants) would be nice, but we got by even without them, no problem\r\nTiny things aside, this place was awesome and we'd absolutely stay here again next time we're in DF.  Love the city, loved the neighborhood of Condesa."

Little things like decor and quality of linens could be improved.  That said, they are all very acceptable and given the cost of the place I think this is a very good match and I recommend.\r\n\r\nAs another reviewer also noted, there is no soap/etc supplied.

Julian and Costanza are both lovely and interesting people and if we ever had a problem they were always on hand. The shared roof terrace is a great little sun trap and a real bonus, and the best thing is you bump into other people that are staying in the block who all have an interesting reason for being in the city. A great apartment, in a great location and run by great people. That's everything you could ask for in an airbnb. Thanks guys!"

For the price compared to other airbnbs in the area it is quite high. The shower does not drain well.  There are bugs that fly in from the shower bathroom. You have to keep it open since there is no ventilation. We had problems the 1st day with the high speed internet and had to wait till the next day to fix the problem.

Ainda bem que neste caso encontramos exatamente o que foi prometido. E com muitas comodidades adicionais: um bonito terra\u00e7o onde era poss\u00edvel tamb\u00e9m lavar e secar as roupas, uma cozinha muito bem equipada (e com tudo funcio0do muito bem ...). Todo o necess\u00e1rio foi fornecido, desde o sab\u00e3o em p\u00f3 at\u00e9 o creme dental! Fomos muito bem recebidos e orientados por Jesus e Constanza (pena que n\u00e3o tivemos contato com Julian), com muita aten\u00e7\u00e3o e simpatia. O apartamento \u00e9 muito bem localizado, em um bairro art decco muito bonito e charmoso, e perto de tudo que precisamos. Passeamos muito pelos arredores. Important\u00edssimo: o apartamento \u00e9 extremamente  silencioso! Dormi muito bem todas as noites ..."

Muy limpio.\nPero hay mucho ruido proveniente de los otros apartamentos.(del mismo edificio)  Si eres joven, parrandero y trasnochador, no hay problema, estaras en la onda.  Pero si eres turismo mas tranquilo, Te acuestas  despues de las 11.00 y te levantas  temprano, para aprovechar el dia,  no es la mejor opcion.\nPor lo demas, muy seguro y huele riquisimo el edificio."

Very safe, very friendly, very lovely area. 2.Communication with Julian and his helpers was super easy over (Hidden by Airbnb) . Check in was a breeze, they brought us more pillows when asked and I felt we were very well cared for. 3. The fridge was stocked with bottled waters which was a very nice touch. 4.Roof deck was a nice amenity, although it was undergoing renovations while we were there.\n\nNow for the not so good:\n\n1. Noise level was off the charts. It was like the apartment was on the street, the construction seemed to be happening in the apartment. We heard everything that was happening in the apartment upstairs, which in our case happened to be a kid crying 24/7. On Mondays they set up a charming little market outside the apartment, but that means that at 6am they are banging metal tubes. Suffice to say I didn't sleep well any of the nights there. Julian and Airbnb were very responsive about the issue, but it was definitely a bummer. 2. Seating surfaces are terrible. The futons in the living room are incredibly hard and upright and are not comfortable at all. The two pink chairs were not much better. 3.Read the fine print, this apartment is not good for more than 3 ppl. Those futons are NOT OK for sleeping on. They are hard, lumpy, and will give you back problems. 4. Needs to be repainted, the walls are all scuffed and chipped and need a little TLC. \n\nOverall, it's a decent airbnb for the price, but it definitely has it's issues so just be aware that you are getting what you pay for. I wouldn't necessarily call it a bargain but it's totally suitable for a group of students."

The communication between Constanza and our group was extremely prompt and helpful. They left a lot of drinking water for us and even re-upped mid-stay, very much appreciated. \n\nThere was heavy construction on the intersection during our stay, but it absolutely did not present any problem to us. If you travel to a city and are sensitive to noise, bring earplugs! The futons were fine as well, but we are very casual, and not picky. Laundry access was amazing, and although the rooftop patio was undergoing renovations, we enjoyed just relaxing up there after a long day of seeing the sights. \n\nThe neighbourhood is fantastic, so much within a couple blocks, but this street itself is quite residential. It is not beside any clubs or restaurants. Can't wait to go back to CDMX, would stay with Julian anytime."

Doors do not keep sound out at all.\nCentral private courtyard next to bedroom which echos the conversations loud and clear into your room ( yeah buddy, I didn't need to hear that you \"like having sex with nice girls\") also the cigarette smoke emanates into the apartment because the windows aren't very secure.\nThe area heaters are a bit small of the space but they give extra blankets.\nLight over bathtub not working so bathroom kinda dark. \nThe hot water doesn't work in either bathroom sink.\nThe faucet to sprayer switch handle in bath doesn't work. \nThird floor of walk up in case you have any leg issues or big luggage.\nOverall an ok stay, but overpriced in my opinion.

Later I had a chance to meet Julian, and he was very kind and helpful throughout my stay. He also speaks excellent English.     \r\n\r\nThe apartment is clean and modern.  The kitchen is well equipped. I was provided with a large jug of purified water which lasted for my 2 week stay.  Some of the criticisms voiced in a previous review appear to have been addressed.  There is now a wastebasket in the bathroom, and, except for one evening, I had no problems connecting to the internet.  The apartment is indeed chilly at night, but there is now a heater in the living room which helps.  Seating in the living room could be more comfortable, but the bed was very comfortable. The roof garden, one floor above, is very attractive.  There is also a laundry room one floor above with a modern washer and dryer.   \r\n\r\nThe location of the apartment is ideal.  The Condesa neighborhood is very safe, and has a wide variety of restaurants.  There are 2 supermarkets within walking distance.  A bit farther away, but still within walking distance, is Chapultepec Park.  \r\n\r\nFor anyone who is staying for a week or more in Mexico City, this apartment is a very pleasant and economical alternative to staying in a hotel."

The kitchen had the basics but we were able to cook without problems. The apartment itself had plenty of room for the two of us, but could use some updating.  Julian and his colleague Constanza were helpful and available if we needed them.  Check-in and check-out were easy and communication before and during our stay was great, even when we had to postpone our arrival due to a family emergency.

She met us and showed us the apartment and gave us keys. We had an issue with the laundry facilities which Constanza very promptly came over and resolved for us at short notice on a Sunday evening, which we thought was very good service.\r\n\r\nOur first impression of the apartment was that it was slightly more worn than the feeling we got from the pictures, but it was clean and bright and comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe location is excellent. The bedroom is quiet because it's away from the street. The bed was very firm but the pillows were a little old and flat. The shower has good water pressure and stays hot. We appreciated that there were fresh flowers in the living room and a big bottle of drinking water provided, as well as shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste and soap. Because we stayed more than a week, the cleaning service came during our stay to replace the towels and clean the apartment.\r\n\r\nThe apartment doesn't have central heating so the living room got pretty cold (it was winter) - we resolved this by moving the space heater out of the bedroom into the living room when we wanted to sit in there in the early evenings. Not a big deal but I thought worth mentioning. \r\n\r\nOverall, a very good experience and we would recommend staying. Thank you for having us!"

While I never met/talked with Julian, I communicated very easily with Costanza and she addressed my every need and concern.\r\n\r\nI do want to point out that the apartment is described as adequately sleeping 3 people (ie. a couple and a single). The futon, however, is rather uncomfortable, and I would not recommend sleeping there for more than a night's fitful rest. The actual bed, on the other hand, was very comfortable, and the apartment is very comfortable and convenient. The cleaning service was a really nice plus too.\r\n\r\nThe rooftop is a nice bonus -- a great space to relax after a long day in CDMX. The neighborhood is the strongest asset -- probably the most relaxing and enchanting neighborhood in Mexico City."

Constanza  manages the apartment on Julian's behalf, and she couldn't be more friendly or helpful. Any questions or requirements were dealt with in a flash! The rest of the staff are lovely too, the lady that cleans the room, and the mainte0ce guy Chucho. The apartment itself is very nice, suitably knitted out with everything one could need. There is the bonus of a beautiful sunny roof terrace, which acts as a nice home office on occasion. Nearby is everything you could possibly need in terms of food, drink, shops and other amenities. I would highly recommend for singles/couples for a short break or longer term stays!"

She was super-responsive as we communicated upon arrival at the airport. When we arrived a caretaker of the house even carried our luggage upstairs, where we found flowers, a gallon of fresh water, shampoo, toothpaste, soap ... a fully equipped kitchen etc.\n\n Since we stayed 9 days, someone cleaned and our linens and towels were changed  in the middle of the stay. The neighborhood is in my eyes the best if you want to enjoy young hip Mexico City, with lots of organic eateries, coffee shops and yoga studios mixed with original little markets, street fare, taco places etc -  there is a happy coexistence of different flavors which we loved. The lushness of the streets is what makes this neighborhood truly special. And despite being a really lively area, the bedroom is totally quiet in Julian's place - we slept like babies!! All in all, 2 thumbs up!! We fell in love with CDMX, it was our first visit there and we are already planning to come back :-)"

Julian and Constanza were both very prompt in their communications. \n\nWe were excited about using the roof deck, but were disappointed to find that it was full of broken boards and holes and not really usable for us. \n\nThere was also a massive construction project (digging up the entire road) right in front of the apartment that was going on for weeks that no one informed of us. It got so bad that the entrance to the apartment was blocked and required us to walk around the perimeter on precariously placed planks over large holes. I would just make sure to check that it is finished before arriving if you have any trouble walking or seeing in the dark. \n\nOverall, I would recommend Julian's apartment if you are looking for location to great restaurants and parks and things to do. However, I would inquire about the roof deck if you intend to use it and about the construction."

Loved it and hope to come back soon. Unfortunately the main road in the area is undergoing some construction as of Feb 2018 so it can be a bit dusty. Communication with Julian and Constanza was always very fast and efficient, and they even left us plenty of bottled water for the duration of our stay. The roof deck is a bit rougher than it looks in the photos (apparently they're fixing it up) but was still a nice place to sit and have a drink in the evening."

The neighborhood was super safe and the place had a secure door to get into the building. Condessa is central to everything you need to get to and has plenty of restaurants and shops next to it to keep you busy. I would highly recommend staying at Julian's place. It is a bit pricier than a lot of the other places around, but Julian was a great host. Our only gripe was with the bed. It was hard and we woke up with back pain on more than one occasion. Otherwise, it was a perfect spot."

The futon and other furniture weren\u2019t very comfortable\n- It could\u2019ve used a bit of cleaning - we found a decent amount of hair in the apartment\n- Floors and walls were extremely thin. We woke up one morning thinking someone was in the apartment but it was our neighbor in the apartment below\n\nOverall: If you\u2019re not planning to spend much time indoors, this is a decent option. Not as great if you want to get cozy/comfortable inside"

Morgana spent a good amount of time on the phone talking to the lost and found at the airport for us.\r\n\r\nThis apartment is in a great location, the La Condesa neighborhood. We spent four days in Mexico City, and came to the conclusion that La Condesa is clearly the coolest neighborhood. You can find lots of great restaurants within a few blocks' walk. The apartment was clean and offered plenty of space.\r\n\r\nThere were a couple of minor downsides. The beds were a little on the hard side. We're now at our rental in Playa del Carmen, where the bed is nice and soft, and has a foam cushion on the top, and I'm definitely noticing the difference. Also the hot water was very temperamental. It would start off nice and hot, then get lukewarm or even coldish a few minutes later. Then you could come back 10 minutes later and it would be hot, although lasting for no more than 10 minutes. This was only really a big deal on our third day, when it got incredibly cold (in the 45 degree Fahrenheit range) and we came home soaked and cold, and just wanted to take a nice hot shower.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, this apartment is a very good value for anyone looking to stay in a cool neighborhood in Mexico City."

We recommend any guests to bring a cell phone, a laptop or a transistor radio. The apartment has no telephone, no radio or television.

The location, while not necessarily central Condesa, was nice in that it was a bit removed from the busy areas. Coffee shop downstairs and grocery store across the street? Big pluses. Also, metro stop is an easy 5 or so blocks away. The apartment is basic, the inner bedroom quiet and dark. Kitchen looks very well equipped, though food is so cheap we didn't end up cooking at the apartment.\r\n\r\nOur biggest complaint was that the shower was a bit tough to deal with as water always seemed to leak out onto the bathroom floor. The other downside was that the wifi was pretty spotty and there was no means of plugging directly into a router.\r\n\r\nOther than that, we had an enjoyable stay. Having never been to DF before, it was a good launching place for the first few days. Morgana was really great to work with, which was essential. "

For those of you travelling to DF for the first time, Condesa is a precious neighbourhood; full of beautiful 20- 30's architecture, very green and walkable. The nightlife can be a challenge in the more central part, but this apartment is situated in a more tranquil area towards Chapultepec; it's very \"local\", and super quiet at night (you will sleep like a baby ;) ) Coffee place, bike rental, laundry places right outside. And Morgana is the perfect host. Definitely recommend staying here!   "

Morgana sent a plumber immediately to fix the situation and then it worked very well.  However, it seemed like something that should have been checked prior to our arrival.  The third day of our stay, water was shut off in the neighborhood for 2 days and we did not have water to shower, flush the toilet, wash dishes or our hands for TWO WHOLE DAYS.  Although this could not have been avoided or resolved because it was a planned shut off, we were disappointed that our neighbors seemed to know about it in advance and Morgana did not.  If we had been advised of this we would never have gone to the apartment and would have asked for an immediate refund.  Although she offered to let us come shower at her house, that was not really a possibility with our 2 year old daughter.  We were also not offered any extra water or partial refund and had to purchase 5 jugs of water just to flush the toilet periodically.  It was truly a nightmare with a 2 year old and myself being preg0t.  This also seems to be a common problem in the neighborhood because when we went to pick up our laundry a few days later the person said they didn't have water and our laundry didn't get done for 5 days.  Then a few days after that the store across the street was receiving extra water because they had apparently lost water as well.  It is possible that this was just bad timing since no other guests mentioned any problems with losing water, but I wouldn't take the risk.  \r\n\r\nAs another guest mentioned, water in the bathroom spilled onto the floor after every shower which was gross because the floor was covered in water.  This is obviously a continuous problem that still needs to be fixed.  The squeegee and drain did not get the job done.  My husband actually fixed the shower head that was squirting high pressure water out of about 5 openings.  He cleaned it and afterward the water came out of the 50 or some odd tiny holes and was much nicer.\r\n\r\n2)  Smell in the bathroom.  There was a sewage smell that got worse as we stayed longer.  I had to hold my breath every time I went in the bathroom.\r\n\r\n3)  Noise inside/outside the apartment.  Two large dogs lived in the apartment below and barked every time someone came or left.  There was construction behind the apartment everyday from 8 am to 5 pm- a loud hammering sound that was constant.  People also coming and going and playing loud music at night, causing the dogs to bark as well!\r\n\r\n4)  Beds were SO hard and pillows were SO flat.  My husband and I would wake up every morning with a sore back/neck/shoulders.\r\n\r\nAs others stated, Morgana was very willing to help, along with her husband.  This is why I gave the place 2 stars because of her willingness to help.  However, these were problems that she could not resolve and, for those reasons, I would stay in a hotel next time.  At least in a hotel if there is a problem with the room you can change rooms or get a refund.\r\n\r\nIf you are just looking for a good location and are young and probably will be out all night anyway, then this will probably be good for you.  The location is excellent and we loved being so close to the supermarket/cafe/torta stand etc.  I also appreciated how her husband came in 20 minutes when we locked our keys in the apartment!  However, in this way we found out that they would be on vacation for the next week and I was stressed all week that there would be another problem and we would not be able to do anything about it since they were far away.\r\n\r\nOne last issue, a cleaning lady showed up randomly in the middle of the day one day which we were unaware of.  Was a nice surprise, but bad timing since we were exhausted and just wanted a quiet nap."

Also, there was no hot water on the morning after our arrival. While Morgana promptly sent someone over to fix the problem, the hot water remained inconsistent, and the shower door leaked to the extent that the bathroom floor was drenched after every shower. The fact that the hot water issue also arose for a previous guest is disconcerting and suggests that this is was not a freak occurrence. (Her comment describes the circumstances in greater detail.) While the shower door leak was a comparatively small inconvenience, I feel that Morgana's neglect to fix this problem reflects a larger lack of attention to detail that was also evidenced by the not entirely clean state of the apartment (particularly the bathroom) upon our arrival. All in all, I would not recommend this apartment for this price. "

Hot water in the shower is a bit tricky but it always work well at the end. The secret: open the hot water tap just a bit until it gets war enough ."

It tooks us nearly two hours to get through immigration/customs - and my phone wasn't working so I couldn't call to warn them - but Omar was waiting for us at the apartment when we got there - he'd had to wait quite a while!\r\n\r\nThe apartment is essentially as looks in the pictures - maybe a tad smaller - but great for my two children and I.  Enough space for everyone to be in their own space rather than on top of each other.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen is small but fully operable - four burner stove, toaster over and a blender (my kids are big fans of smoothies!)   The bed in the interior bedroom is, in my opinion, more comfortable (softer)\r\n\r\nTo the extent there is a complaint, the water pressure in the shower was not fabulous - though Omar told us it takes forever for the water to get hot (which I had read in previous reviews) and that the pressure was not very good.  I don't view that as their fault - kind of is what it is.\r\n\r\nThe grocery store (Superama) is right across the street and open until 11:30 -even on Sunday (the evening we arrived) so you can always pick something up.  There is a fruit stand right outside the door every day - taco/torta stands across the street....  All right out the front door.\r\n\r\nMorgana was very quickly responsive when I contacted her about a couple of issues.  She was a great host for my maiden stay with Air B and B!"

It's basic but has everything you need. It's a great base for exploring DF. It has some cute little mexican artworks inside the apartment. The wifi was very fast. The sheets and pillows were a little worn , but still perfectly adequate. It was very family friendly (we have a 2 year old who loves exploring everything).\r\n\r\nAcross the road there are some 24 hour street taco carts that are cheap and delicious. There's also a well-stocked supermarket in front too. 10metres to the right are a few cute little cafes that are great for a morning coffee. It's a quiet spot that is 6-7 blocks walk to all the action of the area where the hip restaurants are located in Condesa. \r\nThe location of the apartment is perfect. \r\n\r\nWe would definitely return.

We felt extremely safe and were basically able to get everywhere on foot, (we do enjoy walking!) which was a great way to see the city! We also took the metro several times, another great/super cheap way to get around.\r\nThere is a great organic market/restaurant \"The Green Corner Cafe\" a few blocks from the house, and tons of restaurants and cafes within walking distance of the apartment. Origiens Cafe was another favorite. \r\nNoise was definitely noticeable during the evenings, especially from neighbors in the building, so earplugs for light sleepers on the weekend especially. Shower pressure also pretty light! But hot water and fresh towels.  \r\nWe were really happy with our stay and would definitely recommend it to anyone coming to visit Mexico City.

The accommodations are relatively simple, but they're more than adequate for two people.  \r\n\r\nThe apartment is in the bustling neighborhood of La Condesa but tucked away enough to feel a bit more quiet.  There are tons of great restaurants and shops within walking distance, including El Pescadito for fish tacos and Duo for breakfast and pastries.  \r\n\r\nWe really enjoyed our stay and even as two women, always felt completely safe."

Short walk from metro, short stumble home from so many close bars, via the burrito across the street of course. One of my favourite airbnb places I've stayed.

One of the bedrooms lacks a window to the outside, which was a little odd, but overall I would 100% stay here again."

The supermarket across the road has most things and is handy and the battlers who construct their fruit and veg shop 6 days a week are an inspiration and delightfully pleasant and honest with their prices even to \"foreigners\".  The french cafe about 40 metres away has nice coffee and pastries and the 24 hour food stall across the road is still going strong although the cheery Pedro is now doing night shift."

It's close to a supermarket, an organic store and a gluten free bakery! As well as transport and the turibus which my mum enjoyed a lot! Apparently, there was a little bit of noise from some neighbours on the weekends but my mum reported that it was happy noise and wasn't really a problem. Morgana was always helpful with any requests we had, but at times was a little slower to respond  than my previous experiences with other airbnb hosts. She sends a big informative message with everything we needed to know. Which was helpful but I got the feeling I annoyed her a little when I hadn't remembered the instructions properly and contacted her instead, which is far enough I guess. My mum would have liked to change the sheets during her two week stay, but it wasn't obvious how this could have been done and we never followed this up with Morgana either. Mum also thought the place might need a little deeper clean, with some dusty points here and there. But generally I thought the place quite neat and tidy. We had a terrific holiday together and a lot of this was due to the ease this airbnb place offered."

There were no curtains in the living room so everyone on a busy street could see your business. The light in the living room had no fixture, the door knob to the front door was nearly breaking off. The door in the bathroom is made of plastic and almost breaking off. Very basic amenities.\n\nI shortened my trip at the Airbnb and opted for a hotel because there was an unbearable smell that was similar to a plumbing issue. Morgana was very understanding and apologetic so I appreciate her professionalism."

We were only there for three nights and needed a simple place to sleep and shower, as we didn't plan on spending a lot of time in the apartment. \r\n\r\nMorgana was very attentive to us prior to the visit, she replied to my messages almost instantly. She even offered up a driver to pick up my Dad up at the airport.\r\n\r\nThe place is very simple, and you get what you pay for. The furniture is older and flimsy. Dad was afraid he would break the chairs by just sitting on them. The couch was not very inviting. The keys they gave us were especially fragile. One of our keys broke in the lock. The biggest dissapointment was that there was no curtain in the window looking out of the living room to the street. It was kind of a big deal since there is a taco stand right out front that stays pretty busy day and night. Very uncomfortable to have people looking into the window from street level. \r\n\r\nI let Morgana know about the keys and the curtain and she said she would set one up as soon as possible. The best thing about the apartment was the internet speed and the roomy closets. The location is good too, walking distance to a lot of great restaurants. There is a supermarket right across the street too. That was very convenient.\r\n\r\nThis place was fine for a two day stay, anymore than that and I don't know if I could have dealt with the no curtain situation or how uncomfortable the furniture was. BUT Morgana was very nice and responded to all of my inquires. I'm sure if the stay was longer, she would have put up a curtain.\r\n\r\n"

The apartment was loud each morning from street/outside noise as well as other apartments, but that is to be expected in any city. The apartment is not on the ground floor, so the lack of curtains in the living room were not a problem at all for us. \r\nI would advise against using the driver recommended if in a time crunch.  The driver had our flight information, but was 45 minutes late picking us up at the airport.    \r\nI would give 4 stars for the apartment, but the late driver costs another star."

Morgana was also a great host, she checked in on us to see if we had any questions and she even brought over a hair dryer when we couldn't find the one in the apartment (hidden on a high shelf).

I never felt the need for a vehicle and enjoyed many long walks in Bosque Chapultepec, Amsterdam loop and all of colonias Condesa and Roma Norte. One day I even walked all the way to Coyoac\u00e1n and back.\n  I was in the apt for both recent earthquakes and I was surprised that the building suffered zero damage....very solid.\n   The unit itself is very basic but was all I needed....super comfortable bed and comforter.\n\n  I communicated with Morgana and she was great, even bailed me out right away when I locked myself put.\n  I would happily stay there anytime that I was in CDMX.\nThanks Morgana & Omar for being such great hosts !!"

Overall our experience was very positive, though I'll note a couple of things some travelers might want to be aware of. Our host was Mary Jo's father, who was always just a phone call away whenever there was a problem with the apartment. During our stay, a number of little things popped up (water heater tuning off, leak in the bathroom sink). A phone call to Luis and these were quickly taken care of. \r\n\r\nAs advertised, the apartment is right at the southern edge of Condesa. We had lots of fun just walking around and checking out local bakeries (La Artesa was our favorite), cafes (P\u00e9ndulo for book lovers, Maque for delicious savory breakfast), parks (M\u00e9xico, Espa\u00f1a), etc. The apartment was clean and the kitchen and bathroom were functional. \r\n\r\nThe two things I think some travelers will want to know are (1) The bed is not terribly comfortable. I like a firm mattress, my wife preferes a soft mattress, neither of us found the bed easy to sleep on. (2) The apartment itself does not have a particularly attractive view out of either window, though Luis told me that there is a roof-top area with a view.\r\n\r\nConsidering what hotel accommodations in the neighborhood cost, I found this to be a fantastic deal and would definitely stay again."

Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 and her family are simply the best.  Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 wasn't actually in Mexico City when I rented her apartment on account of her NGO work in southeastern Mexico.  However, her parents -- Luis and Vicky, who live a few blocks away -- took more than good care of me.  They were quick to respond whenever anything came up at the apartment, and they always pointed me in the right direction if I had a question.  It should be noted that Luis and Vicky speak mostly Spanish.  I cannot recommend this apartment enough.  I will definitely be staying here again the next time I'm in Mexico City!"

Her father Luis met us upon our arrival at the apartment and was available if we ever needed anything...and amazingly hospitable. MaryJo had emailed detailed instructions on the apartment and how to get around so we felt secure and comfortable at all times. \r\n\r\nMy girlfriend and I spent a week in Mexico, spending New Year's Eve partying in the Polanco district, and came back to a quiet, safe apartment feeling lucky to have arranged such a great place with great hosts. All in all, a fantastic experience that I won't soon forget. \r\n\r\n"

MaryJo works in sourthern Mexico, so her father met me at the entrance to the apartment. Although Luis doesn't speak much English, and my Spanish was terrible, we got along perfectly. He demonstrated how to operate everything that I might need to know. I didn't experience any problems throughout that whole period, but when I was unable to figure out how to re-light the gas heater I called Luis and he arrived within minutes and showed me how to do it. \r\n\r\nThe area itself is wonderful - safe, friendly, and populated with wonderful food and drink. They're a cute park at the end of the block, and two much larger ones minutes away. Here too are beautiful places to run, if you like to exercise. Most things are available at the local market a block or two away, and there's a couple of supermarkets within walking distance.\r\n\r\nI would recommend MaryJo's apartment to people looking for either a short or long term stay in Mexico city. It's perfectly cited if you just want to see the sights, but quiet and unique enough for those who want to relax and explore the city. The fact that MaryJo and Luis were perfect hosts is just a bonus. Highly Recommended!"

The apartment is very close to the metro and to the metrobus, and there's a market close by and many shops.

Conveniently, there's a woman selling chopped fruit and fresh orange juice in the mornings only a few doors down. The apartment also has an ample supply of drinking water, hot water for showers, and good wifi and cable tv. I was able to watch Netflix when I wanted some English programming. Potential downsides: The apartment is next door to a preschool so this can be noisy in the early mornings, the bed is bit firm, and it's located in the inner courtyard on the 2nd floor so there's no city or street view out of any of the windows. Another positive: When I arrived, MaryJo's parents helped me bring my bags up the stairs, explained everything, and had placed some fresh fruits and flowers in the apartment.  "

The apartment is well located and a short walk to Amsterdam and the heart of La Condesa - there are bike racks nearby as well.\r\n\r\nThe space is small, suitable really only for 2 or a family of 3. The wide angle and bright images I felt were a little misleading - there is not much natural light in the front room (you need the light on most of the day). Although plenty in the bedroom. The decor was a bit dated with dark wood and red furnishings, space for our stuff was limited. The kitchen was also a bit dated. Great shower and a very comfy bed. Internet dropped out regularly. With a bit of sprucing up and decluttering this place could be great place to stay. \r\n\r\n#honestreviews"

Maria's family went above and beyond in helping me adjust to life in the city by finding someone to help clean the apartment, offering to help me do my laundry, and regularly coming to the apartment at the drop of a hat if I had any issues (sometimes the water heater would shut off). I had a lovely stay here and will miss my home away from home. "

He was very flexible with our times of arrival and leaving and made life for us very very easy. The place was amazingly clean and nicely furnished, and I was sad I didn't get to use the kitchen as it looked very nice. \r\nThe apartment is located one block away from Reforma which allowed us to walk to different touristy stuff and take a taxi if we needed to go somewhere else.  The area was very safe and it was a short walk to corners stores or restaurants if you wanna go for dinner.  \r\nWe also forgot some clothes on the apartment and Francisco made arrangements to deliver them to us.

First, the apart is exactly as shown in the pictures: new (totally renovated), very clean, WiFi friendly, large enough for 2 or 3 persons (best for 2), great mattress, full equiped to cook and spend some time at home when you don't feel like going out. Secondly, the place is very well located in a safe zone: 30 sec. from Reforma, 5 min. from Sevilla subway station and Zona Rosa, 10-15 min. walking from Chapultepec or Condesa. Much better than living in an hotel room in the Centro or Polanco for a very fair price! Francisco is always just an email or a phone call away. This place is a total winner! "

You are one block from the Reforma, a short walk from the Zona Rosa, the subway and Chapultepec Park.  The street is a quiet residential street in a safe neighborhood.  Although there is no safe in the apartment, I did not feel uncomfortable leaving valuables there, since you have to unlock 3 doors to get into the apartment.  \r\n\r\nThe apartment is attractively furnished and very modern. The bed was very comfortable.  The wi-fi worked very well.  It was nice to have a washer and dryer at my disposal.\r\n\r\nFrancisco was very helpful.  Throughout the reservation process he answered my e-mails promptly.  He was waiting for me when I arrived at the apartment to give me the keys, and was there when I left and called me a taxi.  I had no need to call on him during my stay, but he is only a phone call or e-mail away if you need him.\r\n\r\nMy only complaint was that construction work was going on above me in the building.  There were a couple days where the hammering and drilling were continuous all day long until 6 PM.  (It was very quiet at night however.)  After spending a morning of sightseeing, I was hoping to take a siesta, but it was impossible.  It was also impossible not to track in dust from the construction into the apartment.\r\n\r\nBut once the construction work is done (and perhaps the noisiest part is already done) I would certainly recommend the apartment to others.

The place isn't noisy at all but this is a big city so it's not silent.  We never had any trouble sleeping, actually the bed was amazingly comfortable!\r\n\r\nFrancisco was very friendly and gave us a great first impression.  He always arrived on-time and was very accommodating to our schedule.  We had his number and could call him if we needed to, but we never had any problems with the place.

You are close enough to Chapultepec that you can walk there and enjoy all that it has to offer (which is a ton!).  We actually walked to Belles Artes from the apartment and even that wasn't a bad walk.  We walked along Reforma to get there and the sidewalks are excellent for walking.  You really can walk to all sorts of different feeling parts of the city and there is a ton to do and see and enjoy!\r\n\r\nAlso for a very reasonable price you can catch a Turibus tour from either Cibeles or the 222 mall on Reforma.  Both are a short walk from the apartment.\r\n\r\nLondres street is also full of nice restaurants.  If you want something a little more commercial for breakfast there is an El Globo just 2 blocks South where Londres meets Chapultepec street.  Plenty of good baked goods and a serviceable cafe at El Globo.\r\n\r\nFrancisco is also a wonderful host who is willing to help out if he can.  He was waiting for us outside the apartment when we arrived.  He printed our return boarding passes for us and also scheduled us a Taxi to the airport for our early morning flight home.  He was also very quick to respond through email when we asked for restaurant suggestions.\r\n\r\nThere is definitely some construction going on near the apartment that can be heard from time to time, but never at night.  The charm and location of the apartment far outweigh any noise / dust from the construction.  We honestly only heard the construction on one or two of the 8 days we were there.  Just something to be aware of."

We arrived a bit early that morning due to less traffic and our red-eye flight, but Francisco managed to arrive on time to meet us and got us settled into our lovely flat. After opening the front gate you are welcomed into a cute residential corridor that had a nice local feel to it.  The premises were quite secure, especially considering that the neighbors kept the front door scrupulously locked (and that's always nice to know when you are traveling with valuables).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flat looked very beautiful with Francisco's interior design, and gets plenty of natural light during the day.  There is adequate enough space for a couple and you can open the windows for fresh air when needed.  In the evening the lighting in the apartment provides an invitingly calm atmosphere, nice for relaxing but perhaps not ideal if you are planning on getting work done.  Overall it is a very comfortable place to spend your days or nights relaxing. The rent also includes laundry (washer & dryer), which worked perfectly (and in house laundry was a big PLUS for our stay). \r\n\r\n\r\nFrancisco is a very sweet, kind-hearted, attentive and helpful host without ever being overbearing.  He was easy to work with whenever we needed anything.  He arranged a driver for a trip to Teotihuacan, and got us a great rate on a scheduled taxi to the airport so never had to worry.  He sorted everything out smoothly and quickly, which I love!  And before I forget, the housekeeper did a wonderful and thorough job every week.\r\n\r\n\r\nI highly recommend Francisco as a host, he provides well styled apartments and exceptionally detail-oriented service.  \r\n\r\nxxxx"

Francisco was a wonderful host. He welcomed us with maps, travel guides and was able to answer every single one of our questions. He had great tips to make the most of out trip. He was a great resource as he's been living in Mexico City for a while. Although I was nervous about the size of the apartment, we had plenty of space for two people and about 5 luggage pieces. It was very comfortable. On our way o Mexico,we had had some issues with our flight and luggage. Honestly, we were ready to turn right around and go back home but when we got to Mexico City, we arrived to what felt like a home. Our trip just got better after that. This was not my first time in Mexico City, so I have other places to compare it to. However, there's no comparison. This apartment is by far the best. "

We were also impressed by the extremely comfortable bed. Francisco provided an electric heater when it got a bit chilly which we also really appreciated. The Sevilla subway station is very close, as is the Chapultapec park. It took a bit of a walk to get to the heart of Roma and Condesa, but it was do-able. My only minor complaint is that the hot water in the shower was a bit inconsistent. We'll be staying here again if we come back to Mexico City. Overall highly recommended."

The apt is in Juarez, which is close to 2 metro stops, bus stops, Reforma where you can grab a bicycle or walk around. You can walk to Zona Rosa, Roma, Condesa and more in under 20 minutes. The location felt very safe at all hours (even when you return at 3am!) Francisco and Rodolfo were very helpful with suggestions for places to eat and things to do. Francisco even left us a map and a copy of Chilangos which has great suggestions for eating/drinking/dancing/live music etc. We had Rodolfo pick us up from the airport which was so convenient and easy. I was actually considering putting all our luggage on the Metro, but am very glad we opted to have Rodolfo come get us. We will definitely return to this great apartment on Tokio!"

It's also walking distance (or short taxi ride) to many of the tourist attractions which is super convenient! The apartment was clean and exactly as it appeared in the pictures. The bed is comfortable and we had no problems sleeping through the night; it's nice and quiet! The apartment also felt very safe with all the locked gates. The internet also worked perfectly!! We had everything we needed. \r\n\r\nFrancisco is a great host and was there to greet us and say goodbye. He was also very attentive and easy to get a hold of if we had questions. He was super flexible with check-in and check-out which was so nice and helpful. He really tries to make sure his guests enjoy their stay.\r\n\r\nI also HIGHLY recommend requesting to be picked up and dropped off at the airport. Taking random taxi's is not very safe when you have your valuables with you. And Rodolfo, the driver but also Francisco's business partner, is a great guy to talk and can tell you about the City as you make your way to the apartment. \r\n\r\nWould definitely stay here or another unit of Francisco's if I come back!

The apartment has everything you need, the washing machine and dryer in the courtyard is great. We were travelling with out 2 year old and Francisco kindly organised a portacot. One night there were issues with the water and he organised for a plumber to come (and accompanied him) - at 9pm on a Saturday night! The apartment is in a great location. We walked everywhere but it's also really close to the subway and metrobuses. All in all a wonderful stay."

Throughout the drive, Rodolfo pointed out interesting spots in the neighborhood and told us things to do in the city. We planned out our trip around some of his great recommendations.\r\n\r\nThe listing is very accurate, the pictures look just like it. It is a remodeled, modern, quaint little studio apartment that's perfect for a couple, and it has a large kitchen and outdoor patio. The only thing I would mention is that one night it was unusually and unseasonably hot and the apartment does not have a fan, but we told them about this and they are getting a fan for future guests. Most nights in Mexico it is breezy and cool and so a fan isn't needed.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is literally in the perfect location, it's only a block or so away from the metro (which is super cheap) and you can use it to get anywhere. It's also walking distance to the main park filled with museums, fairs, etc. It's a lovely apartment and I would definitely stay here again."

The apartment is good and modernly designed, it is a little old outside (as is most in this area).  The windows are frosted and open onto the private walkway for the apartment block so we didn't really open the windows.  It is safe but missed not having a view.  My only request would be to make it a little brighter and especially in the bathroom as not condusive to doing  your make up!  Great value relative to pricey hotels and you get a more local experience out of it."

Francisco and Rodolfo are attentive and gracious hosts (staying well past midnight to greet us after my girlfriend and I\u2019s flight was delayed). The apartment is very neat, clean, stylish and located in a private alley that only residents have access to (so it\u2019s very safe) off of a quiet street. Although there are trendier neighborhoods now (in which F&R have apartments too!!), the apartment is just minutes walk from many of the top tourist and business destinations. There are plenty of nice hotels nearby, so getting safe taxis isn\u2019t a problem. Even though the street the apartment is located in is a block away from major city arteries, the apartment itself is very quiet. But head\u2019s up that it\u2019s located in a private alley, in an urban setting, among other apartments where typical Mexico City residents live. So there are a lot of \u201ccity life noises\u201d of people living in close quarters that are to be expected during the day and nighttime ours (dogs barking, birds chirping, and people talking while walking past window). But I think it\u2019s part of its charm. Also, across the street from the apartment parks a very high-end food truck with some of the best breakfast and lunch food I\u2019ve ever had from a food truck (which has been a lot). So in short, great place, great location, great hosts.\r\n"

You will feel safe and confortable dealing with them and you will not need to worry about anything else but enjoing what this great City has to offer..... wich is countless culture, art, history, modern life, and even great new surprises.\r\n\r\nI totaly enjoyed my time here!.... see you next time for sure!"

Bed super comfortable, as well the day bed very comfortable. Quality beddings, kitchen supplies useful. Small patio off kitchen gives sense of spaciousness. \r\n\r\nOnly items that could use a bit of attention: the door lock was very stubborn, at times had to fiddle with for a good while to get it to open. Should be replaced. Also there is a bright light right outside one of the windows--we covered with a bedspread at night. A drape or curtain would help. Washing machine needs fixing. Neighbors upstairs made some serious noise one night, but not late. \r\n\r\nThese details were all minor, all in all, this was a very comfortable and restful place. "

There was a big bottle of water, iron and ironing board, clean towels and a bar of soap.  Bed is comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe only things I did not like were the water pressure and the size of the sink. The water was hot but pressure was very weak (at least in the morning when I showered).  The sink is tiny, it looks cool but it's not very practical. But these are small things and I would definitely recommend this place."

It's located in a convenient and safe neighbourhood - a short distance from the Reforma, a small walk to the nearest metro station and very close to the buzz of the city. Yet, it is very quiet inside the apartment. The rooms and bathroom are spacious. The hosts were excellent with their tips on local places of interest, using the metro, restaurant suggestions etc. They were friendly and accommodating to our needs. They were also prompt and responsive to all our queries on airbnb and (Hidden by Airbnb) . \r\nUpon Francisco's suggestion, we took the metro and then the local bus to see the pyramids and realized it was a wise decision. We also used Uber which has an excellent network in the city. He helped dispel our fears from all the online claims that we read about Mex City being unsafe:) Ask us, we travelled with our 5 year old and were out almost every night till around 11pm without any issues.\r\nI would recommend this apt to anyone without hesitation. Thanks F&R for being wonderful hosts!"

Rodolfo was great with communication any questions I had he was prompt to reply. Rodolfo and Francisco also gave us there own list of go-to spots for foods that was amazing. My husband & I think they should create that list to share with others-all such great gems tucked away in the neighborhood and throughout the city. The neighborhood is also great-I felt safe walking around after dark. There was just the right amount of activity just turning the corner. Highly recommend a stay with them!"

After our airport nightmare, I was very pleased to meet Francisco at the location, to discover he was friendly and attentive to any needs and concerns we might have.  The space itself is just as advertised, in the middle of a quiet but charming neighborhood with close access to Chapultepec, La Zona Rosa, Condesa and Roma, and a short cab ride from Polanco and the Historic Center.  Kitchen is small but perfectly functional, bathroom is well-equipped, the shower is hot with great pressure, bed is a comfy queen that slept the 2 of us very easily.  All told, this was an excellent accommodation and we were very pleased with both the space and the service that F&R provided. 5/5 stars."

It is in a building of probably another 10+ units or so.\r\n\r\nThe not so good\r\n* No privacy - the apartment is facing opposite of another unit and the access way to other units.  The unit is not equipped with curtains.  If the window is left open the unit is fully visible to the outside world.  I arrived when it was very hot in D.F. and without a/c or fan the windows has to be let open. The weather also attracted mosquitos.  Sadly, without curtain and mosquito nets, I woke up to over a dozen and more mosquito bites as shown in the pix.\r\n\r\nThe bathroom - the building is old and is are the pipes. When finishing the bathroom the used up toilet papers have to be put in a bin.  Personally, I find the practice  unsanitising.  \r\n\r\nWater supply - The next day, for whatever reason, the water tank ran dry and the unit was out of water.  In all fairness to Francisco & Roul they were quick on hand to try and resolve the issue, eventually, when they realise the problem can't be resolved I was relocated to another apartment. \r\n\r\nI visit D.F. frequent as this is a stop gap between my home in Puerto Vallarta and have stayed in a number of private flats & hotels.  Unfortunately, this particular stay has been the least pleasant.\r\n\r\n"

I spent most of the weekend study but enjoyed it anyhow. Bring some speakers and music if you want to get a fully complete experience! This place deserves some house music. Thank you Francisco!"

We travel for work frequently and often looking for hidden gems that are secured, clean and good locations when we want to visit a  new city on the weekends. I recommend the apartment. We had good communication with our host, the description matched everything per the site, the location of the apartment was within a block or so away from Paseo de la Reforma.  If you are looking to enjoy Mexico City and be within the trendy areas, this is certainly the place to stay! It was even convenient for us when booking tours as many of the pick-up areas happened to be hotels along Pase de la Reforma (all very near) and at times picked us up from the front door. Overall, experience was excellent.  \r\n\r\nOn a final small note, we did provide some private feedback to Francisco and Rodolfo in regards to added extra security for locks on top of what they already have in place (which is more than we have seen in other cities we have stayed at) to make sure hosts feel their belongings are 200% secure in a big city. Let's keep in mind any big city has its risks and that is why we provided that recommendation. \r\n\r\nI want to make clear that we had NO PROBLEMS and NOTHING HAPPENED during our stay. The neighborhood was safe and it was an incredible stay for us! \r\n\r\nWhen we look for places to stay, we always keep security in mind as we have unfortunately been victims of property loss while staying at hotels. It is why we LOVE our Airbnb choices and STRONGLY RECOMMEND this place :) You will not regret your choice. "

The apartment location is central to all the sights and sounds of the City and the metro station is a short walk as are some fantastic restaurants nearby.  Francisco provided helpful information for the current events in the city.  The flat provided basic amenities for a comfortable stay and the place was immaculate!\r\n\r\nThe walls of the apartment are thin and with little sound proofing, we noticed more than the usual amount of noise (i.e. footsteps upstairs, flushing of toilets, neighbors chattering outside, etc.) so if you're a light sleeper, it may be something of your consideration, or opt for upstairs stay if available.  \r\n\r\nApart from the noise, we loved the location and the stylish decor of the flat!"

Rodolfo provided transportation from the airport along with recommendations for sightseeing and a quick tour/overview of the place we stayed, and Francisco drove us back. The apartment itself was clean, cute, quiet, and had everything we needed for a wonderful stay. We had a great time and would stay with Francisco and Rodolfo again without hesitation!"

Only disappointment we had was that the washer was under mainte0ce when we checked in. We had book this apartment intending to do some laundry. Also, the tv seemed to have only one channel, which was the preview channel. Not a big issue as we didn't watch much tv. Overall, great stay. Will recommend and don't forget a picture at the instagram-worthy green door at the end of the corridor ;)"

The check-in was great,  Francisco was already waiting us in the apartment. We took Uber from the airport, no issues. The apartment was exactly as described. Wifi signal was strong and I was able to watch Mundial games without lugging. We loved the location, very close to downtown and the biggest park in the city where we loved to spend our time (we spend entire three days to cover the area). There are great food places around (El Califa, where you can find great tacos and Yug , if you like vegetarian).  Exchange just 2 min away with great rates 19-20,  don't change in the airport at 16-17. My daughter got a fewer during the stay and  Francisco & Rodolfo allowed us to extend our check out understanding the case. They are a great hosts and I will highly recommend the place for couple (+ baby).  Thanks for your hospitality and doing it.  All the best!"

The location is central to everything and the subway is 2 blocks away, so you can basically get just about anywhere you want for 6 pesos.  Even though Zona Rosa is a bustling nightlife area, the block where the apartment is located is surprisingly quiet.  I travel to Mexico City a few times a year and I think I'm going to try to book this apartment again in the future.  Great experience and highly recommended!"

Centrally located it's easy to walk or take public transportation everywhere you want to go. Plus, these hosts are incredible!

Francisco was very responsive and replied to any messages I had within minutes. He even met me in person and gave some local tips for my stay at the start of my stay. Overall I really enjoyed my stay at their apartment. \n\nMy only critique would be that it is fairly easy to hear noise from the upstairs neighbor. The neighbor was generally quiet, but expect to hear a little music or average living noise from his apartment at some point during your stay---probably unavoidable for big city living though. (this is coming from someone who lives in NYC)"

I've also booked with Francisco & Rodolfo before at a different apartment and they are always on top of things.  They are responsive and willing to offer help if needed."

We stayed the whole week and really appreciated the little kitchen so we could have morning coffee and relax before tackling the city.  Francisco was the best!  He spent a good 1/2 hour regaling us with all the must-dos in the city.  We recommend very highly."

Unfortunately it wasn\u2019t up to my standards I ended up checking into a hotel because there was too many things that went wrong. Starting with some pillows with questionable \u201cclear stains\u201d that just made me uneasy honestly looked like bodily fluids. Also the curtains had vomit All over them. The place looked as if they had rushed to cleaned it in addition the maids missed cleaning parts of the floor I found dirt by the bed and u see the bed. There is also no ac and all the windows are bolted closed. So on warm or hot days it is  hell. I was literally taking shower to stay cool and to try to sleep but was unsuccessful. The place only has \u201cone ceiling fan\u201d and that is simply not enough :(. When I tried to open the side door to allow some air flow I was attacked my mosquitos. Unfortunately after attempting to fall asleep for hours and being so uncomfortable, I had to check out and into a hotel. I honestly have it a chance till 4am but I was so exhausted and disappointed. I never met the host only the cleaning ladies so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an issue with the cleaning crew.  The host communicated perfectly. But I feel like a few fans and a screen door and a deep, deep cleaning is needed for this place."

He and I had a discussion in regards to the odor of the place that was hard to bare but he said it was common. The apartment could have been cleaner. i.e bedding! Bathroom and floors.\n\nNote bring toilet paper and washing detergent.  I left some detergent and fabric softener for the next guest to use. Be aware you will have to clean down the washer and dryer ahead of time.  Don't put toilet paper in toilet as I learn Mexico has plumbing issues. So I made sure to abide by that."

It is super-cool - I felt like there ought to be a model reclining in the lounge and a photographer taking pictures.  The bed is great, furnishings and everything is superb.\r\n\r\nThe location is excellent - right next to Zona Rosa, and a short walk to Condesa.  There is a great local restaurant for breakfast a few minutes walk away, on C/ London, called Do\u00f1a Blanca.  All up $47 (that's 47 pesos, = US$3.50).\r\n\r\nFrancisco was an excellent host, kept in touch and was very flexible when my arrival was delayed.  (Be warned - at busy times like Friday evening, immigration at the airport and queuing for a taxi can take a long time - it may be well worth booking a car to be waiting for your arrival.)\r\n\r\nI certainly highly recommend Francisco's apartment."

Do not expect a view, but hey! you have a major city as your backyard, so go out and play! \r\n\r\nUs: two international/professional gay men, in their mid 30's from LA who enjoy urban travel and like to experience a city by feeling you are part of it. So this was a perfect fit to us.\r\n\r\nThe only drawback was that it started to get kindda noisy in the AM after 9ish (constructing a building right next to it while our stay), but by then we were getting ready to hit the path anyways.\r\n\r\nHIGHLY recommended!!"

Although other reviewer mentioned that the building from the outside does not look great I have to disagree. Is a 1930s building with a pink facade and charm! And you realize that as soon as soon as you walk on the stairs and you see the beautiful lamps (not only these, but all of the lighting in the apartment is flawlessly beautiful) hanging from the ceiling, you understand you are about to step something special. The house itself is extremely well-decorated (nice, clean design and impeccable vintage furniture! the art work on the walls, namely in the bedroom is just great) and looks even better (if that is possible) in real life than in the pictures on the website! Also, not only is super nice but extremely functional with a kitchen that can actually be used for cooking. The bedding and towels were changed during the stay and the apartment was fully cleaned during that time too. The shower has amazing white tiles and the house has a lot of natural light too. The apartment is cozy and super comfortable. Great mattress, great linens. \r\nFrancisco was very helpful before and during my stay in Mexico City, making sure everything was fine. \r\nGreat location and less than 5 min walk to the subway (Sevilla), this cute and clean apartment by Zona Rosa is super close to a lot of restaurants and shopping nearby. Don't think twice. I had searched several places and I am super happy I decided to stay there. Is by far the best quality/price ratio you might find in Mexico City. "

From the time we arrived to the time we left, Francisco was beyond helpful with any and all questions that we had.   \r\n\r\nThe apartment itself was cute, stylish and perfect for our stay.  The area was safe, secure and was perfect for walking to all the major sights and attractions, and conveniently located near the subway.  In fact, we never had to cab anywhere, because we were always on foot.  \r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a great place to rent in Mexico City, then stop looking right here.  This is better then an expensive hotel, and way more personable.   The only negative is that we didn't get to stay longer! but when we do come back to DF, we will definitely be looking Francisco up again! "

It was located in a lovely neighbourhood, close to a metro station and within easy walking distance to most of the city's attractions. After travelling through Central America (and sleeping on bumpy mattreses!) for the past 2 months, it was heaven to sleep in the super comfy bed! And great value for money after searching for hotels online.\r\n\r\nFranscisco was very helpful when we arrived, taking the time to explain where everything was on a map. He was also very flexible when we asked if a friend of ours could stay one evening. Overall, it was a very enjoyable stay and I highly recommend this property to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in Mexico City!\r\n\r\nOlivia"

The neighbourhood is safe and the apartment is within easy walking distance to the subway, metrobus, great local restaurants and plazas.  \r\nThe building itself is simple, and there's no real view, but that was the only drawback.  Essentially, the apartment is identical to the photos - it's a small space, but excellently decorated to maximize the space.  It was perfect for two people.  There's interesting art and furniture in both apartments.  Everything is clean, new and in good working condition.  There's a laundry machine/dryer as well.  The modern kitchen would be fine for cooking meals - all the basic utensils and supplies are there - but food is so delicious and cheap in the city that we never used the kitchen.\r\nFrancisco was good at getting in touch and he met us at the subway station when we arrived in Mexico.  He gave us great suggestions for things to do and places to go, and was available at all times by text.\r\n\r\nWe'd definitely stay at Francisco's place again if we're in Mexico!\r\n\r\n"

The location is well suited to see the key sights of Mexico City and you can pretty much walk everywhere from there.  We will be recommending that our friends stay at Francisco's place whenever they visit Mexico City!"

Francisco and Rudolfo were great at giving us the lowdown on where the \"cool kids\" hang out, much of which turned out to be great advice.  Within days this place felt like our little oasis in the big city.  Highly recommended!"

It is in the heart of the city and literally 3-5 minute walk to the Metro station, and 2-3 min walk to Paseo de La Reforma, the main strip of Mexico City.  The apartment is clean, neat, and has all that you need, the included wi-fi is a great plus for letting you plan your day trips the night before.  Francisco is around for any questions you might have, he will walk you through the area and suggest places to eat, go out, etc...  He can arrange transportation to and from the airport for a solid rate and it also means you don't need to worry about getting a sketchy cabbie during your pick-up or drop-off. \r\n\r\nI would definitely recommend staying here. It is cozy, but the master bedroom and living room are plenty for 2 people.  The bathroom is super clean and modern, which is a nice touch.\r\n\r\nWe rode the metro all over the city with no issues.  We took the metro to the bus station and then the bus station to Teotihuacan (3 pesos for Metro, 80 pesos round trip from the bus station, 57 pesos for entry to the ruins) great deal and super easy to do.  \r\n\r\nEnjoy your trip and definitely look into staying at Francisco's place."

We were not disappointed.\r\n\r\nWe had lots of dialogue with Francisco before we arrived and Rodolpho was waiting for us when we arrived at the Airport. It was fairly late but Francisco gave us a brief chat and a map which was very useful. We corresponded all the time we were there as we didn't know our exact Itinerary and Rodolpho drove us to a number of places including Teotihuacan and then back to the airport at 5.30 in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe apartment was very tidy, the bed very comfortable and we felt it was a great location to explore the city. We felt very safe in the area. We had a problem with the water one day and Francisco dealt with this very quickly so we were not inconvenienced too much. After visiting the Pyramids Rodolpho dropped us of in the Old town and gave us some great tips on what to see.\r\n\r\nOverall, we had great service.

Francisco has done a great job with remodeling this apartment which is located at an old building, the apartment itself is spotless and has everything you will need. It has a nice private rooftop that is not shown on the pictures but it was one of my favorite spots. I will be back soon. Thanks for allowing me to stay here. Saludos. "

I personally would have preferred brighter lighting in the living room but keep in mind it is a stylistic choice and not some oversight on part of the owners.Also, would have preferred better sound proofing for the bathroom door, but not a big deal.  The laundry , extra bedroom, extra bathroom are up on the terrace which is not every convenient to get to often as the staircase is kind of skeletal.   But the laundry machines are in great shape. \r\n\r\n The WIFI internet is GREAT. I was getting nearly 4Mps and was able to stream my shows in HD. The kitchen is excellent with good taste in the appliances. The bathroom is tastefully done in a modern stylish way with very decent water pressure and PLENTY of HOT water . The bed in the main bedroom is very comfortable. Even the sofa is comfortable to sleep on. Francisco is considerate enough to leave a huge container of bottled water in the kitchen. \r\n\r\nFrancisco and Rudolfo are very professional and friendly. I wanted a space heater for the night since there is no central heating and it was brought to the place promptly even though we didn't have to use it that much as we lucked out with the temperatures at night. We used Rudolfo's ride service to the airport which takes a lot of stress off on the day of travel. I got very familiar with the local area and good at negotiating with the street taxis so I didn't need their rides for other purposes, but that option is there if you need it. \r\n\r\nThe location is convenient to many areas. Sevilla metro is nearby. It is so easy to walk to Condesa or take a taxi for 40-60 pesos since going there is a straight path down Sevilla which becomes Salamanca and then you hop off at the Oaxaca intersection. There are parks , a Sumesa supermarket and plenty of restaurants in the vicinity of that intersection.  If you walk to the left of the Barracuda Diner, you are going towards Roma. If you stay on the right side on Salamanca or Sonora, you will stay in Condesa. \r\nNow, if you want to go to Paseo De Reforma from the apartment, just leave the apt towards Sevilla and take the opposite direction as you would to go to Condesa, There is a fountain a block away in Reforma. A lot of places are here too.\r\n\r\0d despite what I said about the staircase to the terrace, it is still good as an extra area to use if you just want to sleep there on the bunk beds  and relax on the open terrace in the morning or evening when the weather is sunny. Also, keep in mind the windows are all frosted. \r\n\r\n If you want to exchange currency, there is a Santander bank a block away which has a better rate for dollars than the other banks I used. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But, it's quiet at night when you want to sleep.  \r\n\r\nThere was a cute VW beetle 1 block away that's converted into an espresso coffee shop that we loved, too.  :)\r\n\r\nRodolfo and Francisco were communicative and present whenever we needed help, directions or a lift.

If we ever had a question or a concern, Francisco was more than willing to help us out. We also availed ourselves of Rudolfo's car service to the airport and Teotihuacan. Although you can probably save some money in choosing alternate transportation, you simply cannot beat the convenience -- not to mention the time savings -- of using Rudolfo's service.\r\n\r\0d indeed, convenience is probably the best word to describe the Hip Apartment's best feature. The apartment could not really be in a better location, and you will find something of interest no matter which direction you choose to go in. And yet, the street itself is very quiet (but safe), especially at night when it counts the most. \r\n\r\nThere was plenty of room, the wifi was responsive, and the bed comfortable.

Rodolfo picked us up from the airport and dropped us off (at 4 a.m., no less!), and was friendly, chatty, and informative along the way. He and Francisco were both very responsive throughout the trip. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is small, but perfectly adequate for two people (might be tough for more than that). It was clean and stylish, and in a great location--an easy walk to Roma and Condesa, as well as to Chapultepec Park, and a fast metro ride downtown. The neighborhood felt quiet and safe. \r\n\r\nI'd recommend this apartment--and Rodolfo and Francisco!--to anyone looking for an authentic Mexico City experience. "

We were also near some major hotels, so it was easy to coordinate tours (that use major hotels as pickup points).  The area felt safe walking around (two girls) and there were all the necessary conveniences (banks, laundry, convenience stores) nearby.\r\n\r\nThe actual apartment is on the small side (although probably depends on where you are coming from), but has a great use of space and we did not feel cramped in the least.  The separate dining, living, bedroom, and bathroom spaces make you feel right at home and give you enough space to breathe and relax if you have a travel buddy.\r\n\r\nFrancisco was so kind and helpful.  He spent a generous amount of time when he checked us in to share restaurant and direction information. He also checked up on us during our stay and helped organize a taxi to the airport.\r\n\r\nWe would stay here again in a heartbeat!"

They answered our myriad questions, gave recommendations, and arranged for (complicated) airport transfers and a (lovely) private tour of Teotihuacan.  The hot water was a little finicky the our first day (and a random light bulb went out) and Francisco & Rodolfo had it resolved almost immediately.  Our flight was home was delayed for a day and they were flexible and responsive, letting us stay an extra day and rescheduling the affordable airport van.  Really, excellent, professional hosts. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is on the top floor of a townhouse in a modest courtyard building, it's quiet and feels very secure.  The apartment is quite small, (especially for four adults), but its nicely decorated and such a great value. Note: the tiny room with the bunk beds and second bathroom and laundry room are on the roof, you have to go up a flight of stairs from the  hallway to the roof to get to it.  A bit of an awkward set up, but we made it work. "

Quick walk to most of the main attractions. I used Uber to get around and would recommend it greatly if you are going to visit some other sites outside of the downtown area.  I actually bumped into Francisco around the city and being as nice as he is he stopped and asked how things are going and how I was enjoying the stay. Upon leaving the apartment Francisco met me at the apartment and we had a very nice chat about his job, his apartment, and his experience at Mexico City along with sharing my new experiences in the city. Francisco and Rodolfo's place is not only a polished and cleaned getaway spot, but Francisco's attentiveness and care really make it that much more worth it. I will be staying here on my future visits to Mexico CIty. Thank you Pancho. "

Rodolfo gave us great tips about different neighbourhoods and tourist attractions while driving, and they turned out to be very useful. The apartment was the same as the pictures show, although it was still somehow smaller than it seems. On the Saturday night, however, there was a group of young people neighbouring to this apartment partying until very late in the morning. It wasn't a big issue to me, since I'm a heavy sleeper. But the fact that it was really loud should be taken into consideration if you are not good with noise. Overall the experience was great, the location was perfect, and the hosts were super nice. "

It is in the middle of a lot of sites that are within walking distance. The apartment itself is comfortable, clean and well appointed. They provided clean drinking water for us so we didn't have to run and get bottled water first thing and even accommodated a 3rd guest for us last minute. Safe and secure, I would certainly go back or recommend this spot to anyone. Keep in mind to keep the doors and windows shut at all times to avoid letting any mosquitos in the house. "

We also had to be at the airport on our return at 3 am and again Rodolfo delivered us on time for our flight back home in the middle of the night.  This service was very much appreciated.\r\n\r\nWe enjoyed the apartment. (thank you for the tank of drinking water!)  There are two levels with accommodations on both floors.  There were only two of us so the main floor was sufficient for us.  It was quiet at night but the Paseo de la Reforma is only a block north of us.   The internet was great and we used it to contact Uber to get us around the city and they had no difficulties with finding our apartment.   It was very nice to come back to the apartment after a long day walking around the city.\r\n\r\nThank you very much Rodolfo and Francisco for your hospitality!  \r\n"

Hot water was never an issue. There's a large rooftop patio. The layout is a little awkward with each room being separate. It's not open concept if that matters. The bunk beds were in a rooftop room with their own bathroom. The room was warm for during our \"winter\" stay. I can't imagine how hot they might be in summer. It's in a great location, but being on a side street from the main street makes it quite and peaceful."

In general, I would highly recommend booking one of Francisco and Rodolfo's locations - they were amazing hosts and communication was timely and clear. This location was perfect for us. It's on the second and third floor of a quiet street but with Roma and Condesa a short walk away, and there are a few little cafe's within a block for morning coffee. \nThe apartment itself is more like a small two bedroom (1 bedroom and a sleeper sofa in the living room) with another one bedroom upstairs off the private rooftop patio. You could easily sleep five people, but there wouldn't be much space, other than the rooftop, for everyone to congregate. There are three chairs in the kitchen. \nIn the main apartment, the double bed is super comfy and the ceiling fan was a bonus. The single sleeper sofa in the other room was fine for one person for 3 nights. The bathroom was everything we needed - very clean and the hairdryer was great! We didn't use the other bunk bedroom, but the beds (and attached bath) looked really nice. One thing we noted is that it was rather warm in the bunk bed room, so it might not be ideal in the hotter months, but we could imagine it would be perfect for a couple kids/teenagers. \nOverall, I would definitely stay here again!

He was able to find me a place to stay after my original reservation lapsed. He really helped in avoiding a potentially stressful situation. The entire apartment was stylish, clean, easy to find, and very accessible for several points of interest. The apartment has all the essential amenities; washer, dryer, refrigerator, cable ( I was able to watch the season finale of Game of Thrones) and a private roof patio.  The neighborhood was quiet and I felt safe walking around and in the evening when arriving home late. I highly recommend this place for its host, style, value, and location."

Reforma even has a dedicated bike lane, that we used to travel to the historic center. The neighborhood is bustling but not chaotic, very walkable and safe, even at night. Rodolfo was waiting for us upon arrival and gave us detailed tour and information about the apartment. The apartment was clean, well decorated and very comfortable. The roof patio is a wonderful place to enjoy a glass of wine and relax. Rodolfo was quick to answer any questions before and during the trip. They even have lots of local guidebooks available for guests to use."

Unfortunately there was a lot of construction going on at the building and on the rooftop during our stay that we were not aware of, so it was very loud and the rooftop balcony was not available. Francisco & Rodolfo still made the best of it and the stay worth it and I would be happy to return once all the construction is complete! Thanks :)"

When my girlfriend and I first arrived, Francisco was already waiting out front to greet us. He showed us around the place and gave us all the detailed instructions on how to make our stay comfortable. We ended up loving the place.\n\nThe beds and bathrooms were clean and comfortable. The showers worked well whenever we needed warm water. The kitchen was equipped with everything we needed from a stove, oven, microwave, and water was provided for us in the refrigerator.  There were some neat art in the master bedroom and sprawled throughout the apartment which was a nice touch and made us feel at home. \n\nThe apartment was close to all of the main attractions in the city. The neighborhood itself was quiet and peaceful. We had an incredible time in Mexico City and would definitely consider staying at Francisco and Rodolfo's place again."

HOWEVER, on the listing it made it seem like both bedrooms are on the same floor. THIS IS NOT THE CASE. The second bedroom is located outside, up this narrow metal staircase, on the rooftop. It is a tiny room with no circulation with a bunk bed and no drawers or closet. The intention was to split this Airbnb with my friend and I didn\u2019t care if I had a twin bed, but I didn\u2019t think the rooms would be so disproportionate to one another. I could not stay in that room cause of the warm, moist, stale scent and the fact that it was raining almost everyday and I had to go outside to get to my room, so be warned. If accidentally book this listing and want a refund, you will not get a full refund."

After we kept bedroom and bathroom door closed (there's an open window in the bathroom that doesn't close) we had no issues.

It is worth the USD13 you pay per night. Its not a place if you are looking for any hotel type or moderate to luxury stay. Its clean (however if I would do it again I would bring my own blanket and sheets). Its a good place if you are looking for a place to sleep and shower. Also, I would lock my belongings. If you decide to take the place, I would contact the host in advance and confirm the address via email (the address of the unit was mentioned wrongly on airbnb confirmation and the cab driver had to go back and forth till we got the host on phone). \r\nOver all, if you are looking for hostel type of amenities (minus meeting travelers like you) like in a developing country, with the benefit of actually seeing what the local working class community is, this is the place for you.

Jacqueline was extremely welcoming from the start - I had no way of contacting her when I arrived to Mexico City (to let her know that I would arrive later than expected because of the line for taxis at the airport). She, however, waited for me outside the apartment the entire time, which I really appreciated when I arrived. The space was very clean and cozy - exactly what you need after hours of traveling. The apartment is centrally located (less than 20 minutes from el Z\u00f3calo and el Bosque de Chapultepec by Metro on the 1 Line at Chapultepec) and is in a vibrant neighborhood. Colonia Roma is charming, bold, and alive. There is the right mix of the trendy and cutting edge culture and gastronomy that puts Mexico City at the forefront, while staying true to the present and likes of the locals. Needless to say, it's great for young people. If you stay here, go to the taco spot on the corner, Delirio on \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n and Monterrey, and Cafe Raiz de Ma\u00edz. Thank you Jackie for opening your doors to me! I recommend this property wholeheartedly!"

El wifi funciono sin problema todo el tiempo. Tiene varios enchufes en la habitaci\u00f3n, hay espejos tambien.\r\nLa casa esta ubicada en una zona residencial, me quedaba a la vuelta del hotel donde tenia yo un curso, asi que me fue muy pero muy conviente la ubicaci\u00f3n. Cerca hay un punto de metrobus, y a una cuadra y poco hay un punto de metro (subway). Sobre la misma calle hay una lavanderia, y mas adelante un cafe internert si uno necesita fotocopiar o imprimir algo de la computadora, y siguiendo mas adelante sobre la misma calle Chiapas (saliendo a mano derecha) hay un supermercado, y llegando a la calle Medellin, doblando a la izquierda encuentran un Mercado Medellin, hay varios lugares cerca para comer. En fin comento todo esto para mostrar que la habitaci\u00f3n esta en una casa segura, zona segura, viaje sola y me senti tranquila cami0do inclusive hasta cerca de media noche, la zona esta bien auxiliada, pero sobretodo Jacqueline y su hermana Lourdes, te hacen sentir en casa y dispuestas a darte la informaci\u00f3n necesaria. Asi que mi evaluaci\u00f3n de la habitaci\u00f3n Chabela es muy buena para una opci\u00f3n economica y segura en DF Mexico."

Y tanto Jacqueline como su hermana Lourdes estan siempre disponibles para asesorar al huesped.\r\nLo unico tener en cuenta que hay varias gradas. La habitacion esta en el 3 er piso."

Fomos da Praia de Copa at\u00e9 os murais na regi\u00e3o Portu\u00e1ria, ou seja, em pouco tempo vimos boa parte da cidade.

There are metro stations for two different lines within 10 minutes, a bus within 3 minutes, and a taxi sitio within five minutes.Spanish, French, and English languages are spoken by the hosts.

The pictures on Airbnb are great but when you get there you are truly awed by the gorgeous home. Francisco and his wife were soooooo sweet and helpful and they provided us with a local cellphone. We had a delicious breakfast every morning prepared by their housekeeper Yolanda. They have adorable dogs and live in a very well located part of town. It was so easy to get around from there! My only suggestion is to have a map with the address of the apartment with you when you are arriving because their street is rather small and some taxi drivers only know the surrounding streets. A map totally eliminates any problem for the taxi finding it. I plan on returning to Mexico City very soon and when I do, I will always try to stay with this wonderful family!"

Yolanda their live-in housekeeper looks after you better than your mum! You awake to a full breakfast set out on the table and come home to clean towels,bed made and clothes washed and folded. Travelling long term can make you a tad weary and staying here is a heavenly haven. The pictures don't do this house justice as the real soul of this home is with the people who dwell there. Te quiero Maria y Paco y Yolanda!"

It was great to come back after a day of adventure and be in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. We had our own private area outside our room to unwind and read with a glass of wine. Yolanda, the housekeeper is amazing, huge breakfast every morning, lots of fresh fruit and cooked breakfast if you wish. Francisco even dropped us at the bus station the day of our departure on his way to work. What more can you ask for?I highly recommend a stay here."

The house was great, very representative of the pictures we saw online; quite a beautiful place, and the location was quite convenient, near many attractions we wanted to see.

While we spent most of our days out of the house exploring, we still got to spend a little bit of time with our hosts and had a good chat.  We would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to visit Mexico City and we would love to stay during our next visit."

Dec 18-27, 2012. \r\n\r\nPaco and Maria\u2019s house is located in the heart of the city near Chapultepec Park, which houses a number of major museums, galleries, historical sites and family activities. \r\n\r\nTheir home is a stunning, open space plan, ceramic tile floored, airy and bright design, with white walls and lots of perfectly placed art pieces, along with Paco\u2019s photographs taken during their travels.\r\n\r\nThere is an interior courtyard where there\u2019s a lovely table and chairs, flowers, small lawn, flowering trees and bushes. The main floor has a big entrance hall, a library, and the living room with two distinct seating areas, the dining room and very modern kitchen. \r\n\r\nThere are two resident dogs \u2013 Maya the St. Bernard, and Copito the terrier (exact breed unknown). They are both sweet-natured and welcoming to guests. \r\n\r\nOn arrival Paco sat me down and gave me the basics: map showing where their home is located, a map of the subway stops, the basic rules of the house, how to use taxis, etc. He also provided me with a cell phone that had his numbers, Maria\u2019s numbers, and the house number, taxi companies & emergency numbers. So thoughtful.\r\n\r\nTheir housekeeper, Yolanda, is a complete charm. She prepares a big breakfast spread every morning, cleans the guests\u2019 rooms and the house each day. She also kindly did my laundry for me when I asked if I could use the washing machine & dryer. What a treat! \r\n\r\nEach guest room is equipped with plenty of electrical sockets for your smart phone and computer, a desk and chair, a closet and storage. And the corner room also has a mini-fridge and a TV \u2013 they have HD, satellite TV.\r\n\r\nI watched their giant TV in their beautiful living room when in the mood \u2013 mostly CNN in English and a few shows in English, which was nice after struggling with Spanish all day.\r\n\r\nAll the home\u2019s sleeping rooms are on the second floor with a view of the courtyard. There are two guest rooms with double or queen beds, one with an additional bunk bed, each with a small couch, good-sized desk and chair. There is one smallish bathroom on the second floor with tiled shower, sink and toilet for the guests\u2019 use. There is a another small powder room on the main floor. There is also a lovely, open seating area on the 2nd floor with a coffee table, travel books and comfy couch and chairs. \r\n\r\nPaco and Maria are kind, thoughtful, intelligent, curious people. On my last full day, they took the time to drive me to the street where I lived as a child, and drove at a snail\u2019s pace so that I could scour the area for our old home. \r\n\r\nMy deepest thanks to Paco, Maria and Yolanda for a lovely stay!\r\n\r\nCheers, \r\nJudy McLarty\r\nSunshine Coast, British Columbia, Canada\r\n"

We could not recommend staying with them more. The house is beautiful, light, spacious and uniquely positioned, very close to Chapultepec Park and a short walk/drive away from anything you want, especially trendy restaurants and bars. We have been taken care of not just as valuable guests, but as part of a family. Maria Jose and Paco  gave us great tips every day in terms of what to see, when to see it and how best to to experience it. we also had amazing food at breakfast (included), freshly prepared by their skillful housekeeper Yolanda. Paco even looked after me like a family member who happens to be a doctor when I caught a bad cold. He provided me with medicine and advice and was always there if needed. I cannot stop talking about what a great experience we had in Mexico City with Paco, his family and friends. All I can say is if you want to live this city to the full, stay as long as you can at Paco's, book early and once there, listen to every bit of advice they give you. You'll have a memorable time, guaranteed! Thank you guys, we will be back for sure."

Hay un jard\u00edn ideal para descansar y sentir el sol; una cocina-comedor amplia y muy bien decorada (prestar atenci\u00f3n a las geniales fotograf\u00edas de cada rinc\u00f3n y pared); al igual que cada espacio de la casa, donde al observador atento le gustar\u00e1 descubrir nuevos detalles. La habitaci\u00f3n privada es espaciosa, tiene una cama muy c\u00f3moda, microondas y refrigerador. En suma, nos hubiera gustado pasar m\u00e1s tiempo en la casa, tan linda y acogedora!\r\nAhora bien, el premio del alojamiento se lo llevan sus geniales anfitriones: Paco, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 y Yolanda. Fuimos recibidos con gran hospitalidad y amabilidad, r\u00e1pidamente nos hicieron sentir parte de su cotidianidad. En seguida, nos dieron mapas \u00fatiles de la ciudad, de la Colonia, del Metro, buenas recomendaciones de cosas para hacer en M\u00e9xico (Museos, paseos, lugares donde comer). Hasta nos prestaron un celular local, para comunicarnos siempre que necesit\u00e1ramos con ellos. Excelentes anfitriones y grandes personas. M\u00e1s de una vez Paco nos escuch\u00f3 y nos dio sus buenos consejos, no s\u00f3lo de qu\u00e9 hacer all\u00ed en la ciudad, sino tambi\u00e9n de c\u00f3mo y por d\u00f3nde continuar nuestro viaje por M\u00e9xico. Nos sentimos muy c\u00f3modos siempre, fue un placer estar de vacaciones junto con tan buena gente. No tenemos m\u00e1s que elogios y agradecimientos para ellos. Ojal\u00e1 podamos mantener la amistad y volver a verlos pronto, volviendo a su casa o recibi\u00e9ndolos en Buenos Aires (\u00a1Los esperamos!).\r\nPor \u00faltimo, un motivo central de porqu\u00e9 vamos a extra\u00f1ar y desear volver pronto a este hospedaje fue la amabilidad, atenci\u00f3n, dulzura de Yolanda. Desde sus riqu\u00edsimos desayunos con los que amanec\u00edamos - ideales para un d\u00eda intenso de paseo por la ciudad - hasta c\u00f3mo nos cuid\u00f3, mim\u00f3 y malcr\u00edo cada d\u00eda. Siempre atenta a nuestras necesidades y dispuesta a ayudar y hacer que nos sintamos como en casa. \r\nSin dudas, la mejor alternativa de alojamiento en la ciudad de M\u00e9xico, y en lo personal, nuestra mejor experiencia de Airbnb. Gracias Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9, Yolita y Paco, los vamos a extra\u00f1ar!\r\n\r\n\r\nBy far, our best Airbnb experience. Great place, in a real mexican neighborhood, safe and quiet. Great location, near Condesa, Roma, Polanco and Paseo de la Reforma. Delicious breakfasts, comfortable room and beautiful house, fancy and full of nice details. But most important,  the best hosts ever, sweet, nice, polite, respectful, really helpful with everything we needed. Thanks Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9, Paco and Yolanda!"

The house was large, beautiful, well-located, and filled lots of art.  Paco greeted me warmly when I arrived and provided me with information about what to do and see, and how to get there.  He also provided me with a local cellphone and access to bicycles all over town.  My room was clean and comfortable and it was cared for daily by the housekeeper Yolanda.  Yolanda also washed my clothes, cleaned the bathroom daily, made sure I had drinking water, and put out a beautiful spread of breakfast foods each morning.  \r\n\r\nI highly recommend this place; you will not be disappointed!"

Our hosts, including Sra. Yolanda were genial. It's a good option for visitors who wish more space in their accommodation and for relative tranquility. Breakfasts were fresh and wholesome, although I would have liked a little more variety."

It's the kind of place you see in a magazine but at the same time you'll feel right at home. Our room was spacious and both beds were very comfortable. Everything was very clean.\r\n\r\nThe location is very good being close to many restaurants, a huge supermarket and in walking distance from several metro stations. We felt safe walking around.\r\n\r\nEvery morning Yolanda made us an amazing breakfast. A great way to start the day.\r\n\r\nReading back my review it doesn't sound nearly as good as I think it was.\r\nIf you want to meet really nice people, get the best travel advice, have good company during your stay, want to stay in amazing house, feel right at home, get the best stay for your money. \r\nDon't hesitate, this is the place to go!!\r\n\r\nThanks guy's!

Their home is LOADED with style and is a silent oasis from the craziness of the city.  It was as if we were staying in a 5 star hotel!  It is perfectly situated to explore and capture the best of Mexico City. Its  location is close to Condesa and La Rosa  as well as the Chapultepec park.  If you are looking for a 5 star experience and to feel completely comfortable in immaculate rooms that exceed your expectations of an AirB&B room. Its time to stop looking! Time is the most value resource we have. So perhaps its time to stop looking and start booking. \nWe will definitely be back!!!!\n\n\n\n  "

It's also an amazing experience for me before I going to Cuba."

It was our first time in Mexico City and the location couldn\u00b4t of been more perfect. You could get a taxi just a few steps off their front door. A Metro Bus stop was also very close. Metro station was a bit further away (few blocks), but walking distance. Also near, a pharmacy and a convenience store. Every morning Yolanda gave us the most yummiest breakfast with fresh juice, fruit, toast, tea, coffee and a hot dish on ocassion. I hope you can try her \"cordon blue chilaquiles\" dish (our favorite). They have two lovely dogs who were just a delight to spend time with. Paco & Mar\u00eda were so helpful with tips and recommendations to get around the city. They always approached us when they got home from work and asked us if everything was good, and made us feel like just at home. \r\nAs a side note...On our last day, Paco recommended a walking tour of downtown with a friend of his Gabriel from \"Pata de Perro DF\" (Website hidden by Airbnb) which turned out to be our favorite day. We visited colorful markets (Jamaica and San Angel I think) had amazing meals (tacos de carnitas, spanish tapas) and had an insight on the architecture of the city by visiting various historic buildings we would of not gone to if it weren't for Gabriel. Highly recommended!"

It is close to a big park with many big and old trees where the Chapultepec Castle is located. It's about 10 minutes walk to several metro stations. \r\n\r\nPaco and Maria Jose are very nice hosts. They are busy people during the week with their work. We were busy during our stay so we didn't get to talk to them too much or spent much time at the house, but the interaction we had was great. Yolanda who stays with them is wonderful, she prepares breakfast in the morning for us and clean up our bedroom every day; even washed our dirty laundry! The house is spacious with two lovely dogs. \r\n\r\nIt was just a wonderful stay; and if I go back, I will likely to stay with them again. \r\n\r\nYang Hu"

My 3 children and I spent 4 unforgettable nights in two rooms at The Great House and found the accommodation to be everything and more as described by so many others.   Yes, it was clean, spacious, warm, comfortable, well located but most importantly for my family, it was homey.  So much so that after every day of touring the city my children would always ask to return \u2018home\u2019.  I have travelled many times with my children and never have they referred to any hotel as home.  They did here.  Paco, Maria thank you so much.  Unfortunately, due to schedules we didn\u2019t spend enough time with you but when in need of advice and suggestions you were so helpful.  Condesa, my children love you.  I love you.  What a spread every morning.  My eldest wanted to take her with us.  Would return without hesitation."

Breakfast is delicious and around a big table, providing an opportunity to chat with the occasional other house guests, who were all lovely and wonderful too. Maybe a great house just attracts great people? We were a 10-15 min walk from the subway--making it easy to get around the city. Our cozy room actually fit all 4 of us comfortably, a feat of good design - and the room was always clean and tidy when we got back from a day of sightseeing. You should definitely try to stay here!!! Can't recommend it enough."

They welcomed us into their home with open arms and gave us tons of advice on the best places to check out in Mexico City. The location of the apartment left us quite near both La Condesa and Chapultepec Park, and made it very easy for us to take advantage of all the museums, restaurants, bars, clubs, and other cultural sites that the city has to offer. The house itself is very cozy - we especially loved the dogs - and the surrounding neighborhood was also very quiet. (Several neighbors even greeted us every day as we passed them on the street.) We're eagerly awaiting the opportunity to return to Mexico City so we can stay here again!"

It's an open space but snakes around so you are not in each other's faces. The shower is hot and powerful, breakfast is great with fresh fruit and there's even a pot of Vegimite! Can use the kitchen and fridge. Very comfortable and chock a block with art. The pictures on Airbnb hardly do justice to this place. Now for the hosts: what a lovely couple. Their laid back (but truly welcoming) attitude about receiving guest was wonderful. It genuinely feels like their house is your house. Paco even got up with the dogs to wave us good-bye at 5am on our departure day ;-) Maria and Paco make us feel nothing is a problem. What a great place to be on vacation from daily life! Thank- you so much to the 2 of you. Couldn't have been better."

We each had a nice bedroom on the second floor with comfy bed and soft sheets.  We shared a new bathroom with strong shower with plenty of hot water.   We loved all the art on the walls and the spacious open feel of the house.  Enjoyed the little sitting room outside our bedrooms and also the small open courtyard.  \r\nContinental breakfast laid out each morning was perfect for our needs:\r\ncoffee, juice, cereal, yoghurt, toast, and fruit.   \r\n\r\nPaco gave us great directions for taxi drivers to the house (including a few very useful sentences in Spanish).   He met us at the house and gave us a very helpful orientation to the neighborhood - recommended restaurants within walking distance, a Mexico City map, and a cell phone with minutes with his number and taxi driver numbers programmed in.   All extremely helpful.   In addition, in earlier email contacts with him, he had recommended a special concert at UNAM that we might enjoy and bought tickets for us.\r\nIt was an excellent concert and a nice opportunity for us to see the UNAM campus and its wonderful concert hall.    The two cute dogs are an added bonus for dog lovers - they are friendly, laid back, and very well behaved.    The neighborhood was quiet, and we felt safe walking back and forth.   Since we were four, we took taxis almost everywhere - other than walking over to Chapultepec Park.   It was quite easy to hail a taxi on the main street half a block from the house.    "

But, true to the description, Francisco Carlos and Maria Jose have crafted a peaceful, welcoming space in a very convenient location. \n\nThe house comprises three stories. Kitchen, living areas and garden on the bottom, guest rooms above that, and the owners' private quarters at the top. There was plenty of space and it never felt cramped, even with all rooms occupied. The room itself was comfortable and spacious, and tidied daily by the maid. \n\nThe true value of this AirBNB though, was in the personal attention given to guests to make their stay more enjoyable. The hosts were a wealth of local knowledge, and more than happy to assist by providing, among other things: a local cell phone with credit and important numbers, a good map of the city, and bike rental cards. \n\nOverall, an enjoyable stay, and highly recommend."

But for some reason the taxis and drivers always had a difficult time finding the house, so it's always good to keep the address and map on you handy.\r\n\r\nWe did share the house with a few other AirBnB guests that were all very nice and considerate so we didn't have any problems regarding noise late at night.\r\n\r\nIt was a very pleasant time spent in Mexico City, our hosts, even though they were not present really left a great impression and we would love to visit again soon! Thank you so much Paco and Maria for sharing your home with us!"

They greeted us as soon as we arrived explained everything and more to us and were incredibly warm hosts. The house is absolutely stunning just like the pictures, very clean, comfortable it could not be nicer. The location is great, quiet and very safe neighbourhood easy to get around Mexico City from. We then were trying to plan the rest of our trip around Mexico City and Francisco was brilliant in helping us sort out buses and giving us suggestions on where to go which was great. We would without doubt go back there again and again. I highly  recommend staying here."

Initially we were not so sure we would enjoy only having rooms in a private residence, but our worries were dispelled quickly upon arrival at our \"home away from home\" in Mexico City. \r\nFrancisco, or \"Paco\", which he prefers, was incredibly helpful and so welcoming. We consulted him with MANY difficulties and questions regarding restaurants, places to go and see and how to navigate the city (such as using Uber) and he was just FANTASTIC\u2026. the patience of Job. :)\r\nAs for the home itself, what a beautiful, interesting and comfortable place! We had our tiny Chihuahua, Baci, with us and although she tormented both Maya and Copito, she quickly settled in and felt right at home. \r\nThere are four guest rooms (my husband and I were traveling with friends so the four of us occupied two of them) and we had a changing cast of characters that occupied the other two. There were two couples with kids from the UK as well as an adorable young couple from San Francisco. We felt free to hang out either around the large kitchen table (with a great assortment of coffee, tea, cereals, fruit, yogurt, etc. for breakfast), in lovely cozy rooms around the house, or outside on the private terrace. Just a super laid-back atmosphere! A hotel would be disappointing after such a great experience.\r\nWe heartily recommend staying with Paco and Maria and hope to see them again when we are back in Mexico City. \r\n"

They both are busy working people and they live on the top floor of the house so we never bumped into them again, except when sweet Maria came to say good bye. We enjoyed the abundant continental breakfasts in the huge kitchen/dining room, which is a common area shared with the other guests. Over coffee, tea, yogurt, fruit, cereal and toast it was fun to chat with the other guests before taking our daily excursions. The house itself is lovely, large and clean. We really liked the third floor room, reached via an outside spiral iron staircase. There are two super cute dogs--one a huge, sweet, cuddly St. Bernard, the other an independent moppy haired Yorkie who has a fondness for the dried magnolia leaves that fall from the tree in the front of the house. If you depend on Internet for work or correspondence, the best place to get it is in the shared common area on the second floor of the house. Paco explained that the brick walls are the reason the Internet is a bit finicky in the bedrooms. The neighborhood is conveniently located to Chapultapec Park as described. As runners, we enjoyed running there every day--a 5 or 6 minute jog from the house. The metro system is super easy to use, though take a map with you to find it the first time if you're walking. Paco can arrange for his driver to take you places for a reasonable charge, and they also recommend taxi drivers--which is a good idea in Mexico City if you're going any distance. "

This property exceeded all of our expectations.  From the owners arranging their driver to pick us up at the airport very late, to the owners mother connecting with us on a daily basis to check in, we felt very cared for.  Our room was a gorgeous retreat, and the daily breakfast was a very nice touch.  The dogs were an added bonus--they kindly greeted us each evening as we returned from our adventures.  We also enjoyed meeting some very fun and interesting people also staying at the property. I can't say enough wonderful things about this property.  Would highly recommend to anyone coming to enjoy Mexico City."

Warm and inviting, he made it feel as if we have been coming to his house for 20 years. This is truly an ideal spot to come home to after long days exploring all that Mexico City has to offer. Quiet and peaceful with all the amenities you would expect from your own home. He was gracious with his time in answering our questions and making sure our expectations were being met. And the dogs are an added bonus. Highly recommend staying here. "

We were very much at home in the house. \nThere is a 24-hour supermarket around the corner with a secure ATM machine. There are metro stations within a few blocks.

They went above and beyond to make us feel welcome in their house, which was truly our home away from home.  Paco and Maria Jose were not only very responsive from the beginning, but they even made arrangements for a driver to pick us up at the airport, so that we didn't have to drive or get lost; they had two cell phones for us to use while in Mexico, which were key to being able to coordinate our large group of 11 people.  They had maps for us and took the time to explain the places that we shouldn't miss while in Mexico, and they were always very nice and friendly. \r\n\r\nThe house itself is huge, comfortable, and in a great location.  A nice touch during our stay was that every morning we had a great breakfast waiting for us, which we devoured like piranhas.  All in all, we had an amazing time and we were all very impressed by our hosts.  \r\n\r\nIf you are going to Mexico City, Paco and Maria Jose are the hosts you want. No doubt about it!"

When we arrived Paco kindly welcomed us, showed us around and made us feel at home. The rest of our 5 day stay was perfect. We all loved having Maya (beautiful Saint Bernard) greet us when we got home and taking turns sleeping with us every night.  The house is spacious, beautiful, clean and in a great location!

We had used their driver for our group of 11 for airport transfer and a visit to the pyramids. If you are going to Mexico City, you have to take a trip to the pyramids. The kids loved the dogs that were on site. \r\nWe visited the same weekend as the pope and Roger their driver was the best. The pope was at the airport at the same time as our flight so they had closed off all the roads but Roger was patient and got us to the airport even though it took 2 hours. We definitely would stay at this house if we ever went back to Mexico City."

The location of the house is prefect and in a quiet area, but one still filled with restaurants and charm. It's close to Condesa if you're looking for night life and right by the amazing  Chapultepec Park.

Walking distance to La Condesa and Parque Chapultepec but a bit of a trek to el Centro Historico. Paco and Maria Jose are attentive hosts who have thought of everything. A generous breakfast spread including cereals, fruit, toast, jams, milk, and yogurt is laid out every morning. Their driver, Gabriel, is available for hire and he patiently drove us to two far-flung destinations on two separate days, joining us for a tour of Estadio Azteca on one day. Very cool guy. The house is decorated with antiques and artwork so keep that in mind if you're traveling with little ones. Exterior doors are kept open so bring bug spray if you're visiting during the summer. The house pets, Maya (lovable St. Bernard) and Copito (spunky shi tzu...I think), are friendly and offer some welcomed therapy in this overwhelming city. It's important to note that the hosts live in an attached apartment on the top floor of the property and they do access it through the main house so you do run into each other as you come and go or sometimes while using the kitchen. The washer and dryer are listed as amenities but they weren't really available as the dryer usually had laundry in it. A laundry service is available around the corner and they charge 25 pesos per kg. "

He made not only made our trip easier and worry free, but his recommendations were greatly appreciated, as they allowed us to see more of the city than our previously set up itinerary. \r\nFrancisco offered to coordinate our early morning pick up, our drop-off from airport and our trip to Teotihuacan. They even offered to pick up our luggage from the house, drive to the location we were and head to the airport from there. That allowed spend more time exploring without having to come back home. His rates were comparable and the driver was trustworthy, not one person in our group felt the need to contest the charges as in return it gave us a piece of mind and assured us we would reach our destinations with a trusted person. \r\nWhen we had an issue with our Teotihuacan prepaid purchased tour, our driver jump into action and coordinated a guided tour immediately (a person of his trust) making sure our experience would not be ruined. We ended up saving so much money paying on site than what we had spent booking online. \r\nThe house is beyond beautiful. His eclectic design and collection of art gave us all a good topic of conversation anytime we sat at the large dining table. Majority of our group are Interior Designers, so as you can imagine we were in heaven appreciating his d\u00e9cor, style and art collections. \r\nHouse rules were not disclosed but I don\u2019t think they would have been a problem. Our short trip was programmed to spend as much time exploring the city, and not to be in the house. \r\nOverall it was a beautiful, comfortable, clean and safe house. Our host was extremely accommodating and tentative making our stay memorable.  Thank you so much Francisco and Maria, for making our Mexico City trip unforgettable.\r\n"

The house is very nice - spacious with a cool outdoor space. It is located close to the Metro and easily found by uber, if that is your thing. The area around the house has great restaurants within walking distance and several amazing museums are just across the park. \nThe hosts, themselves, are very kind and helpful, and their driver, Gabriel, and housekeeper (I am sorry that I don't remember her name!) are awesome. We appreciated having clean laundry and dishes everyday.\nWhile everything went pretty well, overall, I must say that I was disappointed that we didn't have the whole house to ourselves as indicated by the listing description. You are really renting a room, not the whole house. We didn't know, until we arrived, that other guests were staying in one of the rooms (one of the rooms that we were eyeing, frankly). Also, these guests ended up helping themselves to our groceries, which was inconsiderate. We were looking forward to a more private setting. Honestly, had I known that we weren't going to have the whole house, I would've sought other accommodations. In addition, there were always people coming in and out of the house due to work that was being done. We were mostly out experiencing the city during the day, but when we came back before 6p, we had to contend with construction noise. The house was not a relaxing oasis, at that point. We would've loved to nap before heading back out for the evening, but could not rest because of the work. \nIf you don't mind sharing with other guests and want to stay in a lovely home, this is your spot. But if you are seeking privacy and are traveling with a relatively small group or are a couple, you may want another option."

Something to improve on would be some darker blinds for the rooms and screens for the windows as mosquitoes were a problem and sleeping in was hard with the sun coming through the windows.  Other than that it was a great stay and other would recommend the house especially for larger groups as it is a good deal for a very nice place."

The bedrooms are comfortable and set up in a way that easily accommodates large parties.  The kitchen table is amazing and huge . . . more than enough room for all of us to eat together and play board games.\n\nFrancisco and Maria Jose were so hospitable and helpful.  They were quick to respond to all messages and so welcoming.  Their house staff is also extremely kind and helpful.  We came home to a perfectly clean house every day.  We even had help getting some laundry done a couple times and enjoyed a delicious breakfast one morning at the house for a great price!  It is important to note that the house staff is present every day from early in the morning.  They spend much of their time in the adjacent apartment, but you will see them coming and going and doing things around the house.  This was odd at first to some of our family, but they ended up enjoying practicing their Spanish! :)\n\nThe house is in a great location and close to Chapultepec Park.  We walked to the castle and park one day, and other days it was very easy to get an uber right from the front door!\n\nAs mentioned in other reviews, the family does share the front entrance of the house, and yes there is construction going on currently in the adjacent apartment.  It was a concern at first that our stay might not be as private as we hoped, but Paco and Maria Jose, as well as the staff, were all so respectful.  We hardly crossed paths, but when we did it was nothing but pleasant! :)\n\nI highly recommend this house for your stay in Mexico City."

Breakfast at the home is an option as well, and their canine friends are the sweetest dogs as well. \n\nThey are extremely knowledgeable about the city and the culture and are a fountain of information at your disposal.  Some really amazing restaurants close by (I would recommend Cancino San Miguel) and Panificadora Ermita (pastry shop). This airbnb was a home away from home. I would suggest this to everyone looking to stay in Mexico City. Once you arrive in Mexico City they want you to be as comfortable as possible."

Francisco and Maria are gracious hosts and the 2 pups that live in the home are lovely. They assisted us with transportation from the airport and were very flexible when flights changed etc... there are however, 2 things I feel compelled to clarify for anyone considering this beautiful home.\n\n#1 It is \"entire home\" sort of. The downstairs of the home where the kitchen, living room, and backyard are located is actually the entryway to the hosts apartment too and the maids and gardener/driver are present in this area of the home for large parts of the day. They work on the yard, wash the cars, cook in the kitchen, and do laundry throughout the day so you aren't actually alone in the home ever. In addition the front door stays open (there is a gate to allow their cars in that serves as a front door to the alley) and there were many construction people (working on the hosts apartment remodel) coming and going throughout the day as well. We did not feel unsafe but this is very different from the apartments we have rented all over the world and I feel it is fair to mention so people can make informed decisions about what they are looking for privacy wise.\n\n#2 There is a young children's school/music school that shares a backyard wall with the home. We could hear children screaming/singing from 8 AM until about 3-4PM as well as adults on loud speakers teaching the children. This is another point I feel I wish I had known before booking. Some people might not mind this issue however we were all here to relax and sleep in and a few of our party were woken up every morning. \n\nAll in all this is a lovely home with wonderful hosts but I am always led to be honest about any issues that arise during my visits particularly if I wished I had known about the issues so I could make my decisions accordingly."

The hosts were super responsive to all requests and provided lots of help with suggesting activities and with arranging for an in-house cook and transportation.  No complaints at all - but a couple of things that future guest should be aware of is that the house has lots of stairs (some of which are steep and uncovered), you share the house with two dogs, various workers/helpers come in and out of the house throughout the day, and besides a few taco hole-in-the-walls there are no places nearby that are open for dinner (again, these are not complaints but rather are just things for guests to be aware of in advance).   We enjoyed our stay very much.  We will be recommending this house to all our friends and will try to stay here again whenever we come back to Mexico City."

He immediately helped us book tickets since we werent able to. He was quick to respond and make sure we had all the amenities in the home. The home is so beautiful and definitely enhances the experience in Mexico city. His 2 dogs - Copito and Maya were so warm and friendly. We requested a full Mexican breakfast the last day and the Chilaquiles were so filling and delicious. We even enjoyed watching the movie Frida after our visit to the Frida Kahlo museum. I would highly recommend his home to anyone visiting Mexico city (if it is available) :)"

The other 2 rooms are in the house. There is also staff there to help with housekeeping services and a lovely young lady named Karina who prepared us breakfast in the mornings. Fee was $7USD per person and it was worth it. We woke up to a table beautifully set. One day we had chorizo, beans, tortilla, fruit, orange juice and coffee. Next day we had chilaquiles, eggs, toast, fruit, juice, coffee, and pan dulce. There is also a driver on grounds, if needed. He has a small car or a suburban for $180USD per day. We had already hired a private driver, but this would have been much more convenient. The house is in a nice neighborhood, we realized this after driving around and seeing the other neighborhoods. We went out at night (as late as 11pm) and walked to near by eateries, always felt safe. House has a large wall and metal door around it, that is accessible by code. I should mention 2 dogs live on the property, in case you are allergic to dogs, but they are very friendly. \nThe patio out back is beautiful, so green and well decorated. We spent a lot of time out there. overall this place is great for large groups. The house is spread out well enough so everyone has room to themselves, noise does not travel, and the gathering point (dining room) is in the middle and large enough fo accommodate everyone."

We met Francisco on our first day and he took the time to draw on a map points of interest and suggest best ways of navigating the city. It was just me and my two best friends and the house definitely is meant to accommodate larger parties but there are so many cozy nooks, it never felt too big for us. The house staff, Karina and Gabriel were very nice and helpful. Gabriel picked up as from the airport and drove us to the pyramids and Xochimilco, which allowed us to fit things into our schedule as we wanted to and were very happy we took them up on that. We also decided to do the breakfast with Karina on our last day before the airport and it was a great way to start the day. Overall, it was a very pleasant stay in a beautiful city."

The neighborhood is very safe lots of great local restaurants nearby and if you are a Luis Barragan fan you can walk to several of these interests points. The park nearby is wonderful for strolling and many museums they\u2019re all within walking distance. The rooms are spread out as the place is large with three floors we stayed on the top floor with a private balcony from the other guests. I highly recommend this place if you have time to spend in beautiful wonderful Mexico City. The host conveniently arranges a car and  meal preparation if you so wish.\nDo it now.

There is a chain supermarket a few blocks away and plenty of places to eat within 15 minute walk.\nThere was a bit of miscommunication, all bedrooms does have their on bathrooms, but they are all upstairs.  We asked if there were any bedrooms on the first floor and we were told yes.  What we didn't know was that the ground floor counts as a floor, and the bedrooms are located on the second and third floors.\nThey do keep their house very clean, however the bed sheets and towels are old and paper thin.\nThere is no real street parking (again narrow streets), but there is a public parking lot about 2 blocks away for 20 pesos an hour.\nOverall, there we 8 of us and we felt comfortable after we started to ignore all the wall cameras on the common areas."

He helped us get settled and recommeded excellent restaurants. He even escorted us to the market (a great market! If we had stayed longer we would have stocked up on many of the wonderful things they sold there and made use of the great kitchen in the apartment) on Tuesday. The apartment itself was huge and nicely decorated. The balcony overlooked a lovely little courtyard. The condo was set back on a quiet side street. The neighborhood was terrific. It felt safe for strolling through at night and was within walking distance to many restaurants and the park. My boyfriend and I agreed that we wished we lived there!"

Once we discovered he had the same sensibilities as us we spent an hour upon our checkin discussing different restaurants, the neighborhood etc. He left us a local cell phone to make reservations and to call him. He was quick to respond to emails and issues we had. ( We had 2. A. Water was off a small handful of times for several hours- not sure if this is normal in Mexico. B. The condo while beautiful amplifies the noises from the upstairs neighbors. We are not particularly sensitive to sound but her footsteps were amplified to sound like a hammer pounding on the walls at 7:15 am her alarm wasn't any better. Eric had said he would talk to her about holding off on putting on her shoes, but we are pretty sure it is the construction. We loved the apartment, but bought earplugs so we could sleep in on our vacation.) \r\n\r\nThe apartment is in a great location. The neighborhood reminds me of LES in NYC or Venice in Los Angeles. It is hip and urban, feels authentic and safe-- with students, artists and alot of younger people. There are many little cafes, street food trucks ( the guy at the corner at Durango is good)  and there are numerous solid restaurants within walking distance. Eric's neighborhood guide is spot on-- many of the places on his list were on ours as well. \r\n\r\nThank you Eric!\r\n\r\n"

The host was friendly and accommodating, making himself available for any of my queries. Biggest pro: location. Con: occasional noise from the neighbours, but this is easily sorted by having a chat with the host. El departamento es espl\u00e9ndido..."

We really enjoyed the Tuesday morning food market just blocks from the apartment.  \r\n\r\nA few pluses about Eric's apartment:  \r\n\r\n(1) It's very quiet, as it's a courtyard apartment down an alley from the main street, but it still gets great natural light.  \r\n(2) We had reliable internet service in the apartment, which was an unexpected benefit.  \r\n(3) Eric is a real foodie and can help orient you with tips about the newest restaurants. We especially enjoyed his recommendation of Maximo Bistrot in Colonia Roma.  \r\n(4) There's a taxi stand on the street right by the apartment, which comes in handy, and metro Sevilla is just a short walk away.  \r\n\r\nAll in all, I highly recommend his apartment."

Regina welcomed us and explained everything we needed to know about the apartment, she was very warm and talking to her made me smile. \r\n\r\nThere was food in the fridge to fix a small breakfast which was amazing, also some snacks and Eric was kind enough to leave a bottle on wine and some Tequila for us.

Good kitchen with coffee, tea, etc. I felt really welcome with wine, fruits and bread waiting for me on the table. \r\nBring some warm clothes, it's a bit chilly in the flat. As somebody else also wrote, the construction somehow amplifies every step the upstairs neighbours take, and the sound is quite disturbing even for a not-so-sensitive sleeper. \r\nDidn't get to meet Eric, but he was very helpful and responded quickly and friendly to whatever question I had. I warmly recommend the flat and the host! Thanks!"

The kitchen is stocked well for basic cooking, which we took advantage of, though there is plenty of great food nearby.\r\n\r\nThe apartment basically straddles La Roma and La Condesa, two very nice neighborhoods in the city. This is also one of the more easily walk/bike-friendly areas of the city. Lots to do any time of the day, and easy access to the metro or to buses for access to other parts of the city. Keep in mind that La Condesa/Roma are the more expensive neighborhoods in Mexico City, so prices are a bit higher in general."

There's a cab stand outside the alleyway, a pharmacy on the corner and tons of great food near by. We stayed there a week and loved the whole area. The apartment is clean, bright and sunny, and there's pots and pans to cook with if you like. They have fresh bottled drinking water service so you have clean water to drink at the pad and you can fill up your bottles before you head out on the town. We walked all over the neighborhood and it's extremely safe, even at night. We didn't get to meet Eric since he was out of town during our stay, a neighbor let us in and gave us the keys, but Eric was super communicative over email. We heard some noise from the neighbors, barking dogs etc at night, but it didn't bother us too much. If you are used to city apartment living it shouldn't be a problem. We just shut the bedroom window and used the fan that's provided. Much better than being isolated from the locals in some hotel somewhere! Definitely a great location to check out the DF!"

Everyone seems to be reviewing Eric, who is quite responsive, very helpful, and seems like someone you'd want to have a beer with.\r\n\r\nThe lofty ceilings are razor-thin and cavernous, which echoes every single sound coming from above.  Dishes clanking, conversations happening, and phones ringing start off benign - but the upstairs neighbor entertains several nights a week and wears high heels in the flat, a guaranteed wake-up alarm whether you want it or not.  Several sleepless nights and far-too-early mornings left me wondering what repercussions and options I had as a temporary te0t.\r\n\r\nI could somewhat justify paying hundreds of dollars for the zombie-ish malaise - I've sunk thousands in rent to my own upstairs neighbor nightmares of the past.  Sometimes you have to grin and bear it and shake your fist at fate.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately having no water the first night and the next airbnb te0t showing up in the early morning on our departure date (more confused than we were that the other was there) was incredibly awkward and makes me re-think whether the convenience of a kitchenette is worth the headache of a not-hotel.\r\n\r\nThe location is beyond perfect and Eric is a good guy, but buyer beware you should bring earplugs, knock-out drugs, or patience in abundance."

There are numerous bars, restaurants, cafes, boutiques, and beautiful parks within close walking distance. The apartment itself is nestled in a quiet, peaceful community, making relaxation easy. We did not experience any disruptive noise from neighbors above as mentioned in other posts. The kitchen pantry was well stocked, along with fresh fruit, queso and tortillas. Fiber optic wifi was up and running, as well! Upon arrival, we were greeted with keys from Gustavo, the building attendant. Gladly, we were able to meet Eric upon check-out. He's such a nice guy and was a great host--very responsive to email throughout our stay and happy to provide tips and suggestions, as needed. I will definitely return to this lovely city and Eric's flat!"

So lost, in fact, that Eric started to worry. \r\0yway, he was patient enough to wait for me at the apartment for about two hours, which was greatly appreciated (it was even fairly late in the evening by that time).\r\nIt\u2019s a really nice apartment to come \u201dhome\u201d to.  Spacious, homey and comfortable. And Eric had even left a bottle of wine as a welcome present.\r\n\r\nAs for location, it\u2019s in a great place. I spent most of my time in Condesa with my friends, and it\u2019s all pretty much within walking distance. Eric had left a list over his favorite places (restaurants, cafes etc) in the neigborhood, which was a nice little touch of him.\r\nI stayed for a little over a week, and had no real complaints. I did lose the water one evening, but Eric sorted it out very quickly via email(!).\r\nAll in all, I\u2019d say Eric\u2019s place is a great option if you\u2019re looking to stay in one of teh nicer areas of the city. Peaceful, quiet, great location, very responsive and helpful host.\r\n\r\nI do have one possible reservation, which I should mention. During the week, I woke up with some nasty bug bites. I had gotten them during the night, and I intitially thought they were mosquitos (I foolishly slept with the window open the first couple of nights), but they kept showing up even with the window closed. I still have no idea what bit me, I never saw any other bug, so I can\u2019t say if it was  mosquito, ant, bedbug or spider (the highest contenders), I can only say they showed up during the night.\r\nApart from that, I enjoyed my stay a lot, and would definitely consider renting from Eric again. I can only hope I left as good an impression as a lodger as he did as a host. This was my first stay in an airbnb flat, so I might have missed some of the unwritten rules.\r\n"

The apartment was very modern, uncluttered, and comfortable. Eric was a cool host and he'll have a whole list of suggestions ready for your stay. Check-in and check-out process could have been smoother. Apartment wasn't ready at our arrival, and even tho we were told no one would come after us, the next guest showed up waiting to get into the apartment. It wasn't a big deal, but a better coordination there would have been nice. Also, the bath tub water lingers. Just a detail again, but I always appreciate full disclosure when I read reviews so there ya go. Overall our stay was very pleasant and I'd recommend anyone to stay there!"

It was spacious and modern. \r\nThe bed was extremely comfortable (the best of our whole trip) and we really enjoyed the location. \r\n\r\nIf you've ever been to other Latin American cities; this reminds me of Buenos Aires. The neighborhood was quaint and there are great restaurants within walking distance. Wonderful parks as well. \r\n\r\nThe kitchen and the bathroom were not well stocked with soaps/hand-soap, but otherwise, it was great! "

This was my first time in Mexico city and while I had no agenda Eric greatly helped me to put one together and was available for questions, recommendations, etc for my entire stay.

The court yard is just off the main alley and tucked behind a gated entry. This was peaceful and secluded. I would highly recommend this apartment, great value, well kept and great location.

In my opinion the best possible place to get around. The appartment itself is beautiful and has everything you need plus a stunning rooftop belonging to the whole house which you can use aswell. Eric is a warmhearted supernice guy, helping you if needed and giving great tips. If we go to df again this would again be our number one preference to stay!"

I could cook breakfast which was good(as in a good thing,don't know how good you would think my breakfasts are). Spacious apt. in a wonderful neighborhood. Since we had two separate stays in Mexico City , it was great to stay part of our time in Roma/Condessa and the other in the Centro Historico. Both are great,but in different ways. Roma is more relaxed and closer to the park,and of course \"very hip. As Eric mentions, the apt. is very close to others and sounds do pass from one to another.Depending on who is occupying adjacent places,a person who is a very light sleeper,and goes to bed rather early might be distracted. We had a great time."

In fact, we were almost out till past one most nights and didn't have issues walking home late. There was a convenience store on the corner and a radio taxi counter next to the building. Eric was so lovely, he came and met us at the apartment and even helped us with directions when we got lost on a cab. Drinking water was provided along with small snacks.

Well, you can ask for advices on nearby restaurants (see Eric's guide), plus one of the nicest tianguis of Mexico (the market, on Pachuca street, on Tuesdays), a movie theater close by (Plaza Insurgentes),  two beautiful parks, etc.: we spent two weeks in Mexico DF,  and we had a great time, thanks in part to Eric's appartement. The food awaiting us on the day of our arrival and all the books and infos related to Mexico left in the apartment were also very appreciated. When visiting Mexico DF in the rain season, you definitely want that kind of apartment! Merci beaucoup, \u00c9ric.\r\nMarie-Christine et Pierre \r\n"

The bed was hard and comfortable and although the walls were a little thin it wasn't an issue (the ear plugs were a nice touch but we didn't bother with them). After a few tries we figured out how to operate the hot/cold shower and the water pressure was fine. We also really liked this part of Roma because it was very close to metro and on a quieter street. Short walk to street tacos, good coffee, metro, mezcaleria, delicious restaurants and parks. \n"

We have no real complaints with your experience, except the noise from the upstairs neighbor which woke us up every morning.

This flat is situated within 5-10 minutes walk to numerous restaurants and parks. You will live like a local here. Then, when we needed to get to Coyoacan, Centro Historico, etc., the two Metro stations on the Pink line is also under 10 minutes away. We utilized the Sitio stand in front for our longer journeys to the Norte and Sur bus terminals. I was also amazed at how quiet and peaceful the flat and neighborhood was. There is no noise or distraction.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is incredibly spacious, new, fresh, and comfortable. The bed is soft and firm and we slept soundly each night. We bought provisions for breakfast and cooked there each morning. It was convenient and great way to save some money. I recommend the Superama on Eric's map, it had everything we needed.\r\n\r\nWe are definitely planning on come back to Mexico City and we will stay with Eric again. Looking forward to it! Thanks!"

Fortunately we had stayed in the neighborhood before and already had a good idea of where it was along with some of the many restaurants and bars in the area. The nearby taxi sitio at Parque Espana also makes it easy to get around town plus it's a relatively short walk to the Sevilla metro station. \n\nAgree with the other reviews about the upstairs neighbor being noisy.

The tiles are great, and the place is light-filled and spacious. Eric was a great host though I didn't get to meet him- he left a bowl of fresh fruit for us and when we needed help he quickly responded. Luis, the doorman, was very nice and I left my suitcase with him after checking out, which was really helpful. La Roma Norte is an amazing neighborhood with seemingly infinite options for food, drink, people watching. Eric's guidebook suggestions were great. The apartment had a great bed and good bedding, and was quite quiet, though you can hear the neighbors in the morning sometimes.   Wifi was fast, the shower had ample hot water. I will definitely stay here again next time! "

The apt was clean, nice and very quiet at night for sleeping. That area is a nice respite from the 'centro' where things are a bit crazier. Nice to have quiet place to relax. It also has plenty of bars and cafes to walk to very close, taxi stand right out front and very close walk to Parque Mexico, Parque Expanse and Calle Amsterdam. All great places.

We were coming in off a long trip in Cuba and he was nothing but accommodating - even left us some fresh fruit and coffee so we didn't have to run the the store.  Very friendly and welcoming with fantastic suggestions for places to go in the area.  \r\n\r\nThe flat is just as described and very very cool place to stay.  Centrally located in two fantastic neighborhoods, and very quiet.  Would stay here again in a heartbeat and would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking in Mex City"

For an extra fee Eric will leave out a futon which was a great help since my mom and I have different sleeping schedules.  The only two things I would mention are that 1) Eric said he would stop by and greet us with a bottle of wine, but he never did. I understand people get busy and it sounded like he has a little one at home, but it would have been nice to hear from him again before our last day; 2) It doesn't seem like Eric has stayed in the apartment recently because some of the appliances don't work... Some lights didn't turn on and the chairs to sit on the deck were broken, so we couldn't enjoy sitting outside. The flat also could have used a toaster and/or microwave (or maybe those are just American things, but they would've been helpful since when we initially arrived there weren't any matches to light the stove). Anyway, we had a really lovely visit in DF other than those two points - I would recommend this place to my friends!"

Condesa is a great place from which to explore Mexico City. \n\nClose to the different neighborhoods which make the city so special but also a great neighborhood to check out itself. My girlfriend and I ate dinner in Condesa every night be user there are so many wonderful restaurants. \n\nThe apartment itself is spacious, cozy and the neighbors were very friendly. It's much bigger than the photos make it seem and the balcony is a great place to unwind after a long day of exploring. The bed is so comfortable as well. \n\nEric was ready to answer questions or provide recommendations day and night and he lives very close so he knows the area and Mexico City very well. \n\nFantastic place!

We were also starving and he had fresh fruit and cookies welcoming us. The apartment is a perfect one bedroom with natural light in every room and a little balcony where you can enjoy your morning coffee. Situated in an alley off a main road, it was very convenient. Eric also clued me in on the Tuesday open market on Calle Pachuca by the apartment where I could roam for street eats and fresh produce. This was one of the highlights of my trip as I miss markets like this from my home country. Majority of my trip in Mexico was spent walking around Condessa, La Roma and Hipodromo where the apartment is located. Can't say enough good things about this place. "

I only realized it was the wrong apartment when I saw used towels in the bathroom! We went upstairs and realized that was in fact the apartment we were supposed to be in. Other than that, the stay was great and we loved the neighborhood! "

I would have loved to give this airbnb a 5-stars rating but there are 2 caveats. First, the bedroom ceiling is wooden, and the bedroom floor of all the flats in the building are also wooden, therefore you will hear every step the neighbor above you will take, and believe me he/she can walk with passion, so as a light sleeper I was served a wakeup call every morning at 6AM. However, Given the great reviews, I assume it would not be a big deal for most people, but it exists, and worth mentioning. The second caveat is very minor, the hot water runs out quickly, and the water stream is weak - but this is true to almost every place in mexico city so its not a unique issue, but its still also worth mentioning."

It's located in a fantastic part of town... blocks away from Contramar, which all my LA friends raved about, and close to tons of other great (and more affordable) food options including a delightfully aromatic bakery baking fresh goods daily right out front and a charming Italian joint with cappuccinos and savory Italian treats and cups of wine to go for shockingly little money. Also nearby are  parks roaming with gorgeous dogs and the ecobici bike system is fantastic. Eric's place is understated earthy, modern, foliage-intensive cool with an amazing patio to enjoy the summer storms and imagine your alternative life in Mexico City.  "

The area has many walkable cafes to go to. There's a nearby pharmacy, store and even an office depot (in case you need a travel adapter!)\n\nThe flat itself was very stylish. I did a lot of work in the dining room and the natural light from the windows were nice! During my stay there was a newborn in one of the units (upstairs) and I could hear the kid cry all night. The walls are pretty thin, luckily I had ear plugs. The bed was super comfy, I got a good night's rest. Bathroom is spacious and overall the place provided more than enough space to get comfortable. I'm also glad that there wasn't a TV, I didn't spend a lot of time indoors."

Pictures are exactly as you get the flat and not deceiving at all. Cleaning service was a delight to have and Ma. Carmen was always very helpful and available even though we didn't get to meet in person because of the holidays. We would certainly stay in her flat again and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to stay in a central location in DF. Only downside is that the lift has not worked for over 4 months although was advertised at time of booking as property with lift. Sadly this meant lugging suitcases up and down 4 floors and could not have my grandmother visit as is wheelchair bound. This was out of Ma. Carmen's control but would have been good to know ahead of confirming booking. \r\nWe recommend this flat to anyone who appreciates home comforts in style, and Ma Carmen as a host was a pleasure to liaise with."

The staff was sweet, attentive, and reliable, serving delicious breakfasts and cleaning the room every night. I stayed in the penthouse and loved it -- it was lovely, very clean, and had an ideal location in beautiful Condesa. The penthouse itself is very private -- just be warned that it requires a hike of many stairs! The kitchen was well-stocked and the bathroom and closet area quite large. I was very happy with my stay and definitely recommend it!"

We had 15 guests stayed in the other studios/bedrooms and it was a perfect setting for a group visit to CDMX. The pent house was a little smaller than expected, but very chic and perfect for the 2 of us. We also had our guests come up for a surprise nightcap, slideshow and birthday cake after a long birthday meal at Pujol and it fit everyone perfectly! Lucky for us it stopped raining by the end of our trip and we were able to enjoy the roof garden, which has a nice view and lots of recliners/seating. We even had an impromptu dance party up there. Overall a wonderful experience. We can't wait to visit CDMX again--4 days is way too short!! Thank you Condesa Haus!"

Will hopefully be back soon. 10/10"

On short notice, we ended up with a third guest and Penelope was able to accommodate us with an extra mattress on the floor.  Positives were easy to find location, good neighborhood, and a nice rooftop patio area for eating, enjoying a beer, or just watching the sunset. Negatives are access to the studio we stayed in required climbing clear to the roof and then navigating a small spiral staircase to get down to the bedroom and bath.  Might be great for younger back-packer guests, but is a drawback for anyone traveling with more luggage or with physical limitations (like being a recent back surgery patient!).\r\n10-15 minute walk from a couple different metro stops, and the Condesa neighborhood has plenty of places to eat and relax."

The location is excellent, on a very quite street but just a few blocks from more restaurants, cafes and coffee shops than you will ever have time to try.  Easy access, less than 5 blocks, to practical needs (grocery stores, taxi stands, ice cream etc) subway is about a 10+ minute walk.  The payoff for walking up a few flights up to reach the place is a rooftop deck where we ended up almost every evening, it was really fantastic.  The apartment layout is a bit quirky, enter from the kitchen at the top, the bed and bath are down the stairs, but it all works.  There are no photos of the bathroom as it would be hard to photograph them, the sink is small the shower, which is excellent, is huge.  Penelope was always accessible, very helpful and looking out for our needs, an excellent host.  "

The only downfall is the stairs you have to climb to get up to the apartment. If you travel light that won't be a problem at all.

Right in the middle of all the Condesa action, but half a block off of the closest main drag, so the noise was minimal. There is a rad food co-op called The Green Corner that is one block away. Kombucha, tea, and many other things that can be a little hard to find in Mexico City for hippie-types like me. \r\nThe space was simple and clean and very interesting. It's true that it may not be an idea fit for travelers who are lugging larger heavier loads. You must climb several flights of stairs to reach the entrance to the studio. I was definitely winded by the time we got to the entrance of the studio. You actually might hurt yourself trying to get your things down the very narrow spiral staircase that leads down into the studio space. And watch your head! The kitchen has what you would need if you wanted to make coffee, or a small meal and has a nice view. There is also a nice little terrace area with table and chairs. Great shower! I liked the light-filled kitchen even though it could get a bit warm during the day. \r\nOverall, I would recommend this place to those who are traveling light and are in relatively good shape/health. It filled our needs perfectly for the couple of nights we spent there. And, again, you can't beat the location. Thanks Penelope! I would definitely stay in this studio again!"

I would recommend this place for someone staying 3-4 nights, towards the end of my week I did find myself yearning for more in the way of a kitchen. Overall, price is good, location is good, facilities tidy."

It is well suited for one person or a couple, and was \"fully stocked\" with everything from water to paper towel to toilet paper to soap. Appliances functioned, the toilet worked as expected, and there was ample water for showering (which is not always the case in Mexico). The bed was comfortable, and the sleeping area cool, even during the afternoon heat (bonus!!!!). Did not watch TV, but the WiFi worked admirably (also can be an issue in Mexico). \r\n\r\nI only have two comments \"of concern\": the area seems to be inundated with noisy little dogs, who bark incessantly. I hate that. And the spiral staircase between the bedroom and the kitchen is tight. Very tight. Think submarine in WWII tight. Large and heavy luggage would be an problem. (OK, keeping with the theme of stairs, I will only add that the studio is situated at the top of 50-something stairs, so, again, that is not a climb that everyone can make multiple times a day, especially if you have vertigo or mobility concerns.)\r\n\r\nAs to the area, Condesa, amazing!

Close to metro and supermarket. Very safe. It is a charming building with three floors and many other small studios. The studio has a small mini-kitchen above the main room in a sun room that is also the entry. I am lucky I am reasonably fit because otherwise the stairs up to the apartment and the steep spiral staircase from kitchen to room would have been a challenge. It worked fine for us. I enjoyed sitting on the patio and listening to the birds and sounds of the residential neighborhood. Although we didn't meet in person, penelope always immediately responded to questions by email or text. We appreciated the thorough guest notes, especially helpful for calling a taxi for the airport!"

In addition, Penelope and her family are incredibly warm and welcoming, and Penelope was very helpful during our visit to Mexico City! We had the fortune of staying not once but twice in Penelope's studio, as used Mexico City as a home base for our road trip through Mexico. Our plane was delayed and we arrived much later than expected- even so, Penelope promptly let us in and gave us a tour. Penelope was also quick to reply to all messages. \r\nWe stayed in the studio for both Christmas Eve AND New Year's Eve, and Penelope invited us to celebrate with her family (who live downstairs). They were all wonderful and we really appreciated her kindness. \r\nThe place itself has a great charm and beautiful light in the kitchen area. The patio access is also amazing and relaxing after a day walking around the city. The bedroom and bathroom (down a spiral staircase) feel private.\r\nAll in all, I definitely recommend Penelope's studio!"

She lives in her building and rents out multiple units in the same building. To access the unit, we climbed 3 flights of stairs to the roof and then down a narrow spiral stairs to the unit itself. So don't bring anything larger than a carry-on and be physically prepared. We did hear street noise and noise from people lounging on the roof. Bring ear plugs if you're sensitive to noise. Great neighborhood with tree lined streets and good restaurants within walking distance.  We even found a vegan restaurant nearby!"

The spiral stairs to access the room is very narrow. If you are more than 6 feet tall, be aware...you could hit your head on those famous spiral stairs while heading to the bathroom! We did hear noise from the street, but the most disturbing noise was coming from one (or more) small barking dog in the building.\r\nWifi is very good and strong. The terrace is a nice bonus, but noisy if your not the one using it. The bed is firm, very firm. Too firm to my taste - and that was the deal breaker for us. There was a smell coming from the drain in the bathroom sink. Mexico DF is a beautiful city. We'll be back. But not here.\r\n"

Her apartment is also in an excellent location! Quite close in waking to Chapultepec as well as all the restaurants of condesa and la Roma. \nHowever, a couple things to note  - you will have to to climb four flights of stairs to reach the room, and then upon entering the room you are in the kitchen. To get to the bedroom/bathroom you have to go down a spiral iron staircase that is quite narrow - I ended up leaving my suitcase in the kitchen as getting it down would have been precarious. \nThe bed was comfortable but the sheets were covered in small white flakes, as if they had been washed together with Kleenex or something. Finally, the kitchen roof leaked when it rained, forming a large puddle on the floor. \nOverall not a bad option for the price, but I probably wouldn't stay here again given these issues. "

The bed was very hard, the room had a bit of a funky smell. The small stairway inside the apartment is definitely most suitable for people who can get around easily. But besides that it was quite clean, the location i perfect if you want to enjoy the lovely neighborhood Condesa and we thought the building with the small balconies, abd the look of it all was very interesting, nice and cozy. The hosts didn't speak that much english, and they kind of expect you to be able to speak a little spanish, and they seemed a bit uninterested in welcoming us.

The apartment itself is pretty basic but adequate. Not a place that you'll want to spend a lot of time, but it's quiet and clean for sleeping. As others have noted, you should know that you go up 3-4 flights of stairs to get to the entrance, and once inside, there is a narrow spiral staircase to get down to the bedroom and bathroom. If you're older, with kids, or have a lot of luggage, this would not be the most ideal stay for those reasons.

The neighborhood and building felt very safe and our host Penelope responded quickly to any questions or requests. The apartment has a unique design that necessitates the use of a relatively steep spiral staircase so bear that in mind when choosing this apartment. The views from the balcony are better than the photos! The bed is a little hard (about like a futon) so if you have issues along those lines be advised."

There's a ton of bars and restaurants in the area, it's close to public transit, and the surrounding neighborhoods are a lot of fun. It's easy to get around, we never felt unsafe or overwhelmed. \n\nPenelope's place is great for a few days. It's a great price, the space is unique. It's not as clean or as comfortable as a hotel- but worth it for the price and atmosphere.\n\nThe stairs are no joke when you're lugging suitcases. Pack accordingly. "

It has a lot of pubs, restaurants and places to explore around, the Chapultepec Castle and Park and close by and it is adjoining Reforma. We had a ball of a night at Condesa, partied till 5 AM and the best thing was it was super sage and we walked around pub to pub! The accommodation is very basic and so the price is super nominal too, hence if you are looking for luxury this is not your place! There are a bunch of rooms with baths in the same property which are let out by Penelope, so check all of them before deciding which one you like, the one we stayed at had a spiral staircase to get to the bedroom from the Kitchen, this was slightly hard but we both are tiny and hence wasn't much of trouble, if you are tall and broad and/or are carrying a lot of luggage this might be a challenge.\n\nOverall, we had a great stay, Penelope replies to questions instantly and doesn't interfere unless messaged at all in your stay! We had our own set of keys and would recommend this place for budget travelers who are particular about staying close to the booming nightlife in Condesa!"

I didn't mind as I thought it was charming, however, if you like to have a few drinks or someone in your party that is opposed to squeezing up and down a cramped space I'd advise you to pass as it can be precarious. The kitchen area isn't much and the mini fridge is downstairs, not in the kitchen, so recall the staircase challenge. But I would stay here again, I barely even saw anyone, it was quiet, and it was literally right up the street from tons of awesome bars, restaurants, and venues! Thanks!! "

We were able to walk just about everywhere, it's so close to cafes, restaurants, museums, parks and everything else wonderful about the city.\n\nDefinitely recommended!"

The adjacent terrace provides lovely views of the city. Penelope was nice enough to allow me to store my bag before check in while I took care of my filming obligations in the city. Her mother was very sweet and gave me the key to my room when I returned. Also, as a vegetarian there are lots of great options within walking distance (use the happy cow app to see), which is the 2nd reason why I always stay in La Condesa or La Roma. The 1st reason is because they are beautiful, walkable neighborhoods. Try the coffee shop next door too, it's wonderful. "

Then the bathroom is right behind the staircase and you have to kind of work your way around to get in and out.  I am only 5'10\" and I hit my head on the stairs going out of bathroom, going up and down the stairs in the house, going down the stairs outside the house, and my girlfriend slipped on a misaligned stair going down as well.\n\nOtherwise Penelope was great, the location is very nice and the price is really good.  I would have wished for a bar of soap and a few more towels than were provided but main reasons for my lower ranking really solely had to do with fit and comfort, which while knowing it was a quirky place and setting my expectations, i think i was still just a bit bummed by how much discomfort the situation created.  \n\nLastly bed is very hard for those who that is an issue.  didn't personally bother me and it is a king so very big"

This not only results in it being very cold at night (you'll need the extra blankets Penelope has in the room!), but very humid as well, which makes it difficult for the towels to dry. I also thought some of the furniture and furnishing could be updated, but in the grand scheme of things these are very minor issues.\n\nIf this place is available during your stay, I'd recommend it!"

The bed is hard, the internet is spotty, and its a tough space to navigate for someone who is tall. However, the location is excellent, the hosts are very nice and accommodating, and the outdoor space is a great added bonus. I definitely recommend for solo travelers or for those who want convenience over amenities.  "

There are a lot of sun hours. Furthermore, the location of the apartment is awesome. We found that the whole house felt as typically Mexican. The people that we came across in the house were very friendly. In one word: Perfect!"

The host was very informative about how to get to the apartment but was not warm or welcoming as I am used to with most other hosts. I was also trying to find out about some good places to go for nightlife and she was not informative at all. \nThe place was tidy but I would not say it was clean. The sheets and pillows did not feel clean.\nI gave it a low score because I thought the pictures were deceptive. The spiral stairs to the bedroom were about 2 ft wide and super narrow. The spiral is super tight, maybe 3 4 ft max.They felt really sketchy even when trying to carry down a carry-on bag. Lastly, the lamp hanging over the bed was falling apart. It felt sketchy to sleep under it. \nLuckily I only stayed for one night. \n"

I would not suggest staying there in a cold season because the place was drafty and leaky, but it was very fun for a short stay in the warm summer. There\u2019s nice light and a nice terrace.

The room was very comfortable, and the neighbourhood has so many parks, cafes, and restaurants to walk to. On a side note for vegans, there are tons of amazing vegan food options nearby."

Definitely worth a stay if you're looking for a well located apartment in the city!"

It is definitely a workout to get to the apartment with your bags as the studio is up 4 flights of stairs and then down 1 narrow metal staircase. It was a bit loud in the neighborhood on Friday night but was peaceful the other nights we were there (Thurs, Sat). Some minor complaints I have are that the bathroom soap was so watered down and there was no bath mat or any sort of hand towel, so the bathroom floor tends to get really wet. This is exacerbated by the fact that there is no door on the shower. Other than this we had a nice stay and were able to enjoy many bars and restaurants in the Condesa area."

The only complaints is after climbing all of those stairs, you have to then descend down a tight spiral staircase to get to the room. The mattress was also very thin and can be a bit uncomfortable at times. Overall though, the place was very clean, had a very unique feel and the balcony view was gorgeous. There is an excellent coffee shop next door as well. They are very flexible with check-in and check-out."

The host was accommodating and quick to respond. However, there are about three flights of stairs leading up to the place, and a very narrow spiral staircase in the actual unit. Also, the host\u2019s living room is directly below the unit and we could often hear dogs barking and people talking. Luckily we brought ear plugs so it wasn\u2019t a huge deal. Would recommend this for a solo traveler or couple on a budget."

(Be aware that the circular staircase is a bit limiting with respect to body and suitcase size :) ). \nThe shower is done very nicely and the kitchen has kind of a submarine-tower feel with a great view.\nWe loved our evenings with a glass of wine on the terrace. \nThe location in La Condesa is fantastic! \nThe street is actually very quiet at night, but there are lots of bars and restaurants in the near vicinity. We felt very safe (even walking in the dark!)\nIf you're not looking for some sterile hotel atmosphere but are open for some unusual interior architecture in a great part of town - this is the place for you.\nWe would definitely stay here again!"

If you had mobility issues or large luggage it may be tricky to get them in the room but because we just had backpacks it was fine for us. Penolope helped us book a early morning taxi to bring us to the airport. Thanks Penolope!"

The patio area just around the door is very nice, but note that it is shared among several apartments. There are great cafes and restaurants throughout the neighbourhood, nearly all of which are very vegan-friendly. Three metro stops are also within 5-10 minutes walking distance.\n\nAs others have mentioned, there are a lot of stairs between the front door of the building to the apartment, and the stairs between the kitchen and bathroom/bedroom are VERY narrow (which is clearly noted in the description). I consider myself somewhat petite and I struggled - I relied heavily on the rails for balance. You get used to it after a while, though\n\nPenelope was very easy to communicate with and responded quickly. I had a lot of questions and she was kind and prompt in answering all of them!"

They were also extremely accomodating of our travel schedule and were available to answer any and all questions.  The restaurants on the street just outside the building on Indpendencia are hidden jewels in the centro  There is a lovely pizza place, Romina's, a great French cafe for breakfast or a quick snack, Noisette and several amazing coffee places (including Noisette.)  The apartment is super comfortable and well appointed.  The bathrooms (being American, this is always a big deal for me) were impeccable.  Really nice and functional with steaming hot water! The only small downside is that you only have internet access in the main lobby 14 floors down so having personal (Hidden by Airbnb) conversations was hard but that was more than made up for.  Paulina's sister kindly offered us a wireless modem but it was too slow to use (Hidden by Airbnb) .  This is a pretty common issue in Mexico City so I was not that surprised.  If you decide to stay here, you will be happy you did."

It has the necessities for a traveler ( 2 beds, dinning table, 2 couches, and even an extra mattress in the storeroom) with upscale finishes and the services of a high end hotel . The bathrooms are really nice, especially for being Mexico. North American Travelers will appreciate the bathrooms.\r\n\r\nLocation: Great location!!!! Centrally located! We walked to el Zocalo (5-10 min walk) everyday we were there. Bellas Artes, Feforma & Juarez are really close!  Also, the metro station is a couple of blocks away  so we took the metro to Xochilimlco , Coyoacan ( Caza Azul) & Estadio Azteca. \r\n\r\nHost: Pualina was very responsive via email the whole time. While I was booking she answered every question & after i booked she was responsive as well. She sent me very detailed instructions and even gave restaurant recommendations. Gabriela ( Paulina's sister) who met me at the building was super nice! She  gave us a tour of the building and also let us know about a grocery store & restaurants close by! \r\n\r\nOverall it was a great experience. I would recommend this apartment to anyone traveling to Mexico City! "

The place faces the courtyard, which is fine, but when it's hot and people are talking/laughing in the courtyard, it creates a bit of a quandary: roast inside with windows closed or get a little breeze with noise?

For the first day or two we used the WiFi in the lobby because the modem at the apt was slow and kept dropping the connections. Gabriela arranged for a faster WiFi modem at the apt after the first couple of days - it made our lives a lot easier and saved us a lot of time.  The apt is located in Colonia Centro (downtown), within walking distance of many landmarks (Bellas Artes, Zocalo, Secy of Education (Rivera Murals), Supreme Court (Murals by Orozco and contemporary Mexican muralists), the metro, El Cardenal (a must visit restaurant at the Hilton), shops, Parque Alameda (a very busy park for evening strolls and people watching), mezcallerias (Mezcal, like Tequilla, is a potent liquor made from agave), and banks. The apt bldg is very secure, not that security was an issue.  It has a great swimming pool and gym and the staff in the lobby were very helpful (they can arrange for taxis).  The only hiccup (not Paulina or Gabriela's fault) we had was that the building ran out of water for a night or so.  We came home late one night after a long day feeling grimy and hoping to take a shower before going to bed.  Unfortunately, there was no water and we were not informed of the shutdown (if it was planned) in advance.  We texted Gabriela and she responded immediately with the status.  The water was back on next morning around 8ish.  \r\n\r\nA little bit about Mexico City (aka D.F. - Districto Federal). We arrived with a lot of apprehension after talking to people in the San Francisco Bay Area and reading posts online, Lonely Planet, etc..  We felt very safe in the city  - we rode the metro (3 pesos per person per ride - must be the most inexpensive public transit system) at all hours of the day and night and walked everywhere including late night after dinner (most of the good restaurants are in Roma, Condessa, Zona Rosa, and Polanco).  When we needed help, people were very friendly and approachable.  Not once did we encounter a hostile situation or felt that we were in danger. We took taxis everywhere (approx. 60 - 100 pesos for a 20-30 min ride depending on traffic). However, we took the usual precautions of traveling in a metropolis.  Don't let fear ruin your opportunity to enjoy a wonderful people, culture, and a great cosmopolitan city.  \r\n\r\nLastly, it might take a few days to get used to Mexico's altitude (nose getting dry and labored workouts) and pollution (similar to LA and not as bad as Beijing or Shanghai), but it is definitely manageable.Feel free to email us if you want to know more about the apartment or DF. \r\n\r\nBuen viaje!"

Close to everything, easy to get around and really great food around. The apartment has everything you could need for a short or long stay! And they even had maps, guidebooks and a little surprise waiting for us, true Mexican hospitality! I will defiantly stay here again! And absolutely recommend to all my friends and family.

The place was beautiful and incredibly safe with access to every amenity as well as proximity to the most fun places in DF. Cozy and charming, with comfortable beds and luxurious bathrooms this place felt like somewhere i'd like to live. Alas, I had to leave, but I will surely come back again and again. I'm planning another trip very soon and will be showing the place off to my family when i go back.  In short, this is the best of Mexico City in one place. Stop looking and get it if it's available!"

Paulina and Gabriella were fabulous at everything they are supposed to do.  I can't ask for a better location and cleanliness of the place.  The area is safe (even late at night) and walking distance to many places.  Tour bus pickup is a steps away.  Many great eating places from inexpensive to the high end.  I would definite refer to whoever I know going to be in Mexico City.  And I certainly connect with Paulina the next time I am in town.  It's truly a home away from home.  If you are from the US, just picturing you are staying at an Extended Stay America in a high rise building.  I totally recommend it if you don't like to be in a hotel room environment for days. Lastly, you can't beat the price offer!  You're across from the Hilton and you only pay a fraction of it.  "

Her charming sister Gabriela, who greeted me, gave me a useful tour of the building, with its services, including same day laundry for a reasonable fee (which we used and recommend), gym, pool, and play area for little children. And she was available by phone during our stay and came by the night before we left for a quick visit. The staff at the highly secure apartment building were all friendly and helpful.\n\nDidn't get a chance to use the pool, but worked out several days in the gym. Good vibe there. There's a bike available, too, in the apartment which, alas, I didn't get a chance to ride. Keep it in mind if you will be in DF on a Sunday, as nearby beautiful boulevards are closed to motor traffic, so biking becomes a safe way to explore. I loved walking through the Alameda park with its lavender, trees, fountains, statues and the extraordinary Bellas Artes at the far end. Then a pedestrian street Madero takes you to the Zocolo. Try the Pasteleria Ideal for the best pan dulce ever. \n\nThe fabulous Mercardo San Juan is not far from the apartment and offers fresh fruits and vegetables, fresh fish, and meats, and imported deli foods, too. Chinatown is a step away, too. As are bookstores, museums, monuments. You could stay a month and not run out of things to see and do just steps away.\n\nAs for the apartment itself, the kitchen is minimally stocked for cooking. One small paring knife served for chopping vegetables, slicing bread, and opening a can of coconut milk (as there was no can opener). There were two sauce pans and one frying pan. Plates, large, medium, and small for four. Adequate silverware and glassware. More kitchen towels would have been useful for a week-long stay. If you plan to do much cooking, you might ask Gabriela for a few more kitchen items. I assume there are some stored away in locked closets, and she seemed ready to respond to any needs.\n\nThe apartment on the 14th floor of a 15 story building is flooded with light, though there is no view, as it looks over an interior garden (too far down to be a view). You see the plain exterior of the building surrounding the garden. The apartment has no art on the walls and is minimally and comfortably furnished. I slept well in the bed. Bedside tables would have been useful. Plenty of closet space. \n\nA good place for the 1 year old baby we had with us, as there were no artesania or plants around for her to break or eat by mistake. \n\n\n"

We enjoyed the pool which has a shallow area for little kids and my kids loved the jungle gym in the kids' play area.\n\nThe building is near the main tourist spots and public transportation. If you get sick like one of my kids did, the apt is located near two pharmacies and a walk-in clinic. The location is ideal if you prefer to explore the Historic Center on foot. Lots of shops and restaurants (from major chains to small family-run restaurants and street food stalls).\n\nGabriela was an excellent hostess and immediately took care of problems we had with our internet connection. \n\nThe weekly cleaning service was a treat because someone came in to change the beddings and towels and clean the bathrooms and floors when I was often too tired to do so.\n\nThe only downside was that the neighbors in the the apt beneath us complained that my toddler son was making too much noise, sometimes if he was having a hard time falling asleep. We did our best to minimize the noise, but it wasn't always possible."

Her sister Gabriela was very accommodating with our early morning arrival, greeting us and showing us the apartment and building, and made suggestions on attractions for our visit. We were a party of four female adults (all family) and felt very safe and comfortable in the apartment and even outside the apartment. It was walking distance to Bellas Artes, Torre Latinoamericano, various metro stops, decent restaurants and street food vendors (I drank many licuados and jugos from vendors a block away), and we even walked all the way to Zocalo. If you need to exchange money, there is a bank in the same building but accessible from the outside.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself met all of our needs. It truly felt like a home away from home. After days of walking around and sightseeing, it was nice to come back to the apartment to relax and unwind. Towels and soap were provided, blankets/pillows, the kitchen was equipped with basic appliances and crockery. We did not use the gym or the pool because we were out most of the day and night exploring D.F. There is a market nearby to buy food/snacks and condiments. There is no A/C in the unit however there were fans in every room which we used as the weather was somewhat humid and hot when we visited in late August.  I highly recommend this apartment for a short term or long term stay and will definitely recommend this place to friends and family. Hopefully we can visit again soon!"

The condo is across the street from Park Alameda and easy walking distance to several subway lines. We could easily walk to Torre Latinamiercana for drinks at night and be anywhere in the centro historico in minutes. The apartment is well appointed and very clean. We stayed over a week so Paulina even had someone come clean one day. The showers all worked perfectly and had ample hot water (not to mention HUGE!) and the furnishings modern and comfortable. Ample closet space and the building is fantastic. There's an indoor pool, laundry service, concierge, and lovely public areas. The staff at the building are very friendly and made us feel at home. I would without hesitation stay in this apartment again. One of my all time favorite Airbnb experiences. Thanks paulina!! "

The layout of the apartment gave two couples complete privacy while affording pleasant communal areas in the living room and kitchen. Should probably mention that the security in the buiding is top notch, although we never felt even slightly unsafe walking around the city, even late at night.

The apartment building is incredible - as central as you can get and yet, because of the clever design of the building, extremely quiet and peaceful. Facilities include an acclimatised pool, a very well-equipped gym with personal trainers, a cafe, courtyard seating areas, business centre, even a small cinema apparently. \r\n\r\nPauline and her sister Gaby, who manages it, are flexible, relaxed and welcoming hosts, always on hand to sort out any issues or needs. There is even a foldable bike they are happy for guests to use! (Highly recommended on Sundays when some major roads are closed to traffic in the centre to promote bike use.) \r\n\r\nThe apartment has everything you need and is well maintained and in good condition. Beds are comfy, showers excellent, etc. In terms of style and feel, it has been kept pretty minimal because they don't live there and perhaps they have a lot of turnover of guests, so I guess my only suggestion to make it go from wonderful to perfect would a little more furniture and furnishings, such as bedside tables, maybe  the odd picture, cable TV, to make it feel really feel like \"home\", as it can feel a little sparse if staying for longer periods. However if you're just there for a few nights and mostly out sightseeing this shouldn't bother you. \r\n\r\n"

Gabriela also was very kind to our two boys playing and laughing with them after a ling day of travel. Everything in the apartment and building amenities was accurate 100%! In my opinion there is no better place to stay and visit Mexico City! Location is everthing and several major attractions are within walking distance. Our boys are 8 and 5, they had no problem walking to el Z\u00f3calo, Palacio Nacional, and Bellas Artes. The food choices in the area are amazing and can fulfill any appetite. We truly felt like we were at home our entire stay. This was our first experience with Airbnb and we were fortunate enough to stay here and have a great experience."

Make a point of walking to Bellas Artes and the Diego Rivera museum.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself has all the essentials for your adventures in CDMX. Both bathrooms (one en suite) are recently renovated with very nice showers.

She was such a warm and friendly person that our little girl asked every day if we could go and play with her. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is spacious, well stocked (including a bicycle for guests use!), meticulously clean and in a wonderful neighborhood. The building is one block north of the excellent Museo de Arte Popular and two blocks south of Alameda Park. Many and more beautiful places of interest are within easy walking distance, including the Zolcalo.  \r\n\r\nThe building was large and well maintained, and included comfortable lounge areas and a leafy courtyard with shady seats. There is a cafe right next to the elevator on the ground floor with hot and cold healthy food options, tasty food options, and very strong coffee. Guests even have access to a gym, a pool, and a children's play area. Two concierges are available who will call you a taxi or provide information, as long as you are able to ask politely in Spanish.\r\n\r\n Nothing is overlooked in the apartment in terms of essential living supplies, including umbrellas, sun hats, and a large stack of papers advertising local restaurants and attractions. Despite its central location and proximity to booming loud clubs and nightlife, the apartment is remarkably quiet after 9 or 10 pm. It's really very comfortable. We enjoyed our stay very much.  "

Right near the Centro Historico, a couple blocks from Bellas Artes and the Rivera mural museum. It s also within waking distance from Plaza Garibaldi and the Zocalo, so it'S close to perfect.\nInside the building there is a Gym with a huge pool included. The social areas are very nice and the late improvement is a small store where you can find enough for breakfast or light supper.\nThe flat is very comfortable with two bedrooms and two  bathrooms. The wi-fi connection works just right.\nWe love the place and the place leads us to love Mexico."

It's an easy walk to many of the most important downtown tourist destinations (the wonderful folk art museum is barely a block away and the Palacio de Bellas Artes is maybe a three block walk), as well as many terrific restaurants, bookstores, cafes and bars.  It's extremely accessible to the subway and bus systems, and the people working the door can call you a secure cab if you like.  We ended up not using the gym and pool  (pretty rare in Mexico, actually), but they are quite nice and a plus for those who want/need them.  The kitchen is adequately equipped for basic cooking but really, why?  There are great, inexpensive restaurants all over downtown.  The apartment itself is a bit austere (no decoration to speak of), but very clean and comfortable.  It's a great place for a family or two couples traveling together (our situation).   There are people at the entrances 24/7 and you can't get in without a key, so security isn't an issue.  The WIFI was reasonably fast and completely reliable.  There are (paid) laundry and dry cleaning facilities on the premises.  Overall, if you want to be downtown, it would be hard to beat this place.  We would return."

Lo peor es que no es que las personas estaban teniendo una fiesta ni nada, sino ruido de conversaci\u00f3n normal. Las paredes no son para nada resistentes al ruido y si tienes un sueno liviano escucharas a tus vecinos lavando platos o conversando hasta tarde. No hay ruido de la calle ya que el depa tiene localizaci\u00f3n hacia el interior del edificio.\r\n\r\nEl TV no funcionaba ni siquiera canales locales. Esto estaba anunciado como una amenidad. Medio incomodo porque al llegar de explorar se quiere ver TV un rato.\r\n\r\nEl bano tenia varios cabellos y la alfombra de bano estaba realmente desagradable (muy gastada con muchos pelos)\r\n\r\nPor un error me fue enviado un numero incorrecto de la persona que me iba a recibir. Corregir esto me hizo tener que activar el roaming de datos e incurrir en gastos adicionales (y altos) tratando de localizar a la host para que el numero correcto me fuese dado. Lamentablemente en el aeropuerto no hay wifi gratis si no tiene cuentas de tel\u00e9fono mexicanas (al menos no encontr\u00e9 ninguna senal abierta en la terminal 2)\r\n\r\nLas paredes tienen muchos rayones de color rojo (por las sillas). Es una pena que los visitantes no cuiden las cosas pero no estar\u00eda de mas pintar sobretodo cuando ya se tienen tantos rayones. Tambi\u00e9n una de las tablas cerca de la venta esta floja y puede ser peligroso."

                    "comments": "We were here 11 days.\nPros\n-  Location is GREAT.   Very close walking distance to many major sights and restaurants.  The Centro Historico is crowded and grubby compared to other neighborhoods like Roma, Condesa and Polanco but these others are farther from major locations.   The apartment being on Almeda Park helped with a feeling of respite in a crowded area.\n\n-  Nice building amenities such as a small grocery store and laundry service.  The apartment has no washer dryer or dishwasher.  Not a problem for us.\n\n-  The weather is gorgeous and no rain so come this time of year.  Bring a light jacket for very mildly chilly temperatures in the early morning and evening.\n\n- I came with only one other person but there really is enough room for two couples.   Not huge but adequate.\n\nNeutral \n-  The lighting isn't great for reading.  Bring attach-to- book reading light.\n\n-  The sheets in the second bedroom could have been nicer.   The towels could have been of better quality.\n\n-  It would have have been nice to have on the instruction list where small grocery stores and nearby \nmarkets are.\n\n-  We found the best transportation to be Uber which Lonely Planet lauded for safety and a good price.  Beware of street cabs.  Metro was convenient to apartment and cheap.  Don't take during rush hour as too crowded.   Even Uber and taxis at rush hour and fringe rush hour moves slowly.  This isn't an easy city to get around in except by foot which makes this apartment location so extra great.\n\n-  There was a strong unpleasant cleaning fluid odor, possibly bleach, coming from the bathrooms.  I had to air them out for three or four days before it went away.\n\nCons\n\n- I have stayed in many Airbnb apartments.  I read all the reviews carefully because I am looking for quiet.  Time and again everyone said how quiet this unit is.  Right before we left for MC, I noticed a recent review saying that it was quiet as far as street noise is concerned but not for noise inside the building.  How true!  I could hear the man next door sneeze as well as his phone conversations and music which he played softly and noise from other units as well. The walls are paper thin.  So beware if you are noise sensitive.\n\n- The second bedroom is badly badly badly\n in need of paint. \n\n- A small thing.   Drinking water in Mexico has to be bottled.  Water usually come in huge heavy heavy jugs which swing from a holder to pour as they are too heavy to lift.  The apartment had the bottle but no swinger so you couldn't lift the bottle without a huge effort.  It would have been nice to have the swinger or just buy your own water in smaller jugs at the Oxxo down the street."

The beds and the couches were comfortable, and the kitchen was well-stocked with all the necessities. The bedrooms had plenty of storage space, and though we were close the heart of the city, impressively quiet. I even slept with the window open. The location made it easy to walk around, with quick access to the Historic Center as well as to Chapultepec Forest and Roma/Condesa. The security guard and the secure entrance were also nice features. Great place for a comfortable launching pad for your Mexico City vacation!"

The location is great for a number of reasons:\n1) only a block from Alameda Central and the park with the Palacio de Bellas Artes\n2) only a 5-10 minute walk to the Zocalo and Centro Historico\n3) centrally located makes it easy to get a cab or Uber to check out other neighborhoods; and without traffic only took about 20 minutes to get to the airport!\n4) there are a number of great eateries that are close by (both nicer dining and street food :) )\n5) close to multiple public transport stops - metro, bus, or 'trolley'\n6) close to a Turibus stop too!\nThe apartment was exactly what we needed for a jumping off point for exploring Mexico City.  The two bedrooms were nicely sized for our family of four.  Having the full kitchen helped so that we could have light breakfast before starting our day.  There is a small grocery store/mini mart and a panederia about half a block away.  After late lunches, we found it nice to go back to the apartment and relax by the pool (although you must wear a swim cap, which you can purchase from the store within the building).  Another nice convenience was the lavenderia within the apartment building so that we could have a load of laundry done.\n\nLastly, the hosts were very easy to contact.  Gabriella, who helps Paulina, was fantastic especially since our flight was delayed causing us to check-in around 3AM.  She was easy to contact during the week and made our stay most welcome.  We would definitely recommend this place to our family and friends who plan on visiting CDMX and would definitely stay there again ourselves."

Short walk to Z\u00f3calo.  It was SILENT at night in the apartment, which is so rare for a centrally-located rental.    Other things to note- the apartment is on the 14th floor, there is door security, and there is a kids' play area indoors in addition to a pool/gym/laundry/store in the building.  Oxxo convenience store right across the street, it is one block from Museo de Arte Popular, 2 blocks from Museo Mural Diego Rivera, we ate THE BEST EVER arracherra tacos at Rinc\u00f3n Tapat\u00edo nearby.  PSA- don't ride the metro during rush hours or you might be squished to death. Luckily the nice women onboard offered my children a seat.  Uber is cheap and easy."

Finding an Uber to pick you up is super easy too!  The space is just like in the photos.  The building where the unit is located has a pool, a great gym and a track that you can jog/run around.  It also has a convenience store that sells basic items that are useful during your stay, like bottled water.  The complex also has a dry cleaners/laundry service which is useful if you travel with children.  \n\nIt was very comfortable and had all the basic things that we needed.  When you walk the hallway to the apartment it gives you a great view of the CDMX skyline.  \n\nGabriela, Paulina's sister, was very resourceful and available for all our questions, often sending us information on events and activities around the city that could interest us.  \n\nIt was a great airbnb experience for us and next time we come to CDMX we will make sure to stay here again.  Thank you so much!"

Located in Centro minutes from Alameda park, it provided easy access to a dozen museums and Zocalo (20 min walk). There are also a bunch of good restaurants within walking distance including the amazing breakfast place in Hilton Reforma. The kitchen was also fully equipped and allowed us to a cook a few dinners. The convenience store inside the complex was a god send, they have everything you would ever need. The entrances to the apartment complex were manned 24x7 even though you need access cards to get in. We felt very safe. Noise wasn\u2019t an issue for us but some walls were thinner than expected and the structure of the building doesn\u2019t help either. Sometimes, the hallway outside leading to the elevator did reek of cigarettes. Perhaps, a few bad neighbors are to blame. Overall, will recommend."

The flat is also right opposite a big superama for supplies. \r\n\r\nThe flat is a good size, clean and modern with all the basic amenities you need, very good value for money, I highly recommend this apartment and indeed Morgana.

The host met us on time and gave us the keys, left us with water and gave good food recommendations. The area is safe most hours of the day and night, though it is not as fancy as Hipodromo or parts of Roma nearby. Location is walking distance to all the great restaurants on Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon etc. as well as the subway and museums.  The wireless was my only real complaint. It is a building wide connection that is un-reliable. We also had a small issue with noise as this is a street-level unit.\r\nThe grocery store, torta place and cheese store on the same block is a great convenience."

The location is superb - you can walk to Chapultepec in a few minutes, there is a supermarket across the road, plus many fantastic restaurants just a short stroll away too. Morgana and her husband are lovely and extremely helpful people. We loved our time staying there, and I'd happily stay there again if we went back. I have no problems in recommending this place for anyone looking for a comfortable and affordable apartment in Condesa."

Condesa is the perfect neighborhood for exploring this expansive city. It's got a very European feel with many cafes, restaurants, parks, and markets and it's an easy jumping off point for exploring all the other neighborhoods and outlying areas of DF. The apartment is a close walk to the metro, Chapultepec park, parque Mexico,  and all the goings on of downtown Condesa, but is in a quieter part of town with easy access to the supermercado, organic grocers, etc. Morgana was a perfect host. She made sure we had everything we needed and was really responsive. The apartment is perfect for 2-4 people, very comfortable, and it's really great to have a kitchen and be able to prepare some of your own meals at home. Must more preferable to staying in a hotel. Can't recommend this apartment and Morrgana enough!"

We found that the comments that have been made by others are generally accurate and we share the most positive ones. Morgana is particularly diligent and always available. She and her husband are very nice and caring hosts, who respond immediately to calls and messages  and are ready to offer prompt help and advice whenever needed. The apartment is very clean, cheerful and luminous, simply but tastefully furnished and decorated. Its location is excellent, in an interesting neighborhood, at a walking distance from the Bosque de Chapultepec, with easy access to transportation. The presence of a big supermarket just across the street is particularly convenient. There are plenty of good restaurants, stores and shops in the immediate vicinity, including pharmacies and a choice of laundries and dry cleaners (and, as my wife stresses, several  beauty salons and hairdressers).  The availability of Internet through a Wi-Fi connection is quite important;  there is no TV in the apartment but we did not miss it at all, thanks to the provided access to Internet.  There is a continuous supply of hot water through a gas heater, which is quite important when three or four persons share the apartment as we did. The kitchen is fully equipped with the necessary appliances.  People should recall that it is a third floor apartment without elevator and that they need to carry up their luggage; it was good for us to be aware of that, with the bonus that Morgana even helped us with the suitcases, which was much appreciated!  Overall, we are very satisfied and fully recommend the apartment to fellow travelers. If the opportunity arises, we would be more than happy to stay in the apartment again."

Morgana te provee desde la ropa blanca, toallas de ba\u00f1o, toallas de cocina, papel higi\u00e9nico y hasta pa\u00f1uelos de papel. La cocina tiene todos los utensillos necesarios para preparar cualquier tipo de comida.\r\nLa se\u00f1ora que hace la limpieza es muy buena en su trabajo adem\u00e1s de ser sumamente cordial\r\nJusto enfrente hay un supermercado que abre de 8 am a 11 pm, as\u00ed que siempre est\u00e1 disponible para hacer las compras y es un super hiper completo.\r\nLas contras del departamento... hay alg\u00fan asunto con el agua caliente, pero luego de unas pruebas aprendes a manejarlo ... Y todo depende de cuanto te importe tener TV, pues este no tiene... Para mi fue genial porque solo vi las peliculas que me interesaban en mi computadora.\r\nA Morgana no la conoc\u00ed, nuestro trato fue todo por mail o tel\u00e9fono pero realmente siempre fue sumamente resolutiva en cuanto a mis pedidos.\r\nEl departamento es sumamente recomendable! Es PURA LUZ y AIRE! Y todo lo que quieras est\u00e1 al alcance de la mano... con caminar unas 5 a 6 calles encuentras los mejores sitios de La Condesa para salir de paseo. Me encanto pasar 4 meses en el departamento! \r\n\r\n"

Morgana was great in being flexible with our check-in times (we had already been in the city for a week and wanted to be able to drop off our bags in the morning of our check-in day). \r\n\r\nMorgana's apartment is conveniently located in the safe neighborhood of Condesa and is tree-lined walking distance to many restaurants/cafes.  There is a large supermarket and delicious 24-hour torta stand right across the street as well as a cafe about a block down for coffee in the morning. It is about a 15 minute walk to the subway but also easy to catch a cab if you walk 2 blocks to the left of the apartment.  The apt is a 3rd floor walk up and is spacious and brightly lit (we were a party of 4 and there was plenty of room).  It was just as pictured in the listing. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is simple, clean and well stocked, the beds are very comfortable which was perfect for long days out.  The hot water in the bathroom was a little tricky, but works and the shower water pressure is great.  The internet was a little weak, we could only get a stable connection at the dining table (but there was a great connection in the hallway - so we figured it must be a shared network).\r\n\r\nWe had a great time staying at Morgana's, everything was hassle free and went smoothly!  I would recommend Morgana's apartment if you are looking for a convenient and clean place to stay for your visit to Mexico City!"

There is a great supermarket just across the street, excellent street food, a juice bar on the corner, and several cafes within a block or two.\r\n\r\nIt's a lovely, tranquil, quiet neighborhood, safe to walk around at any time of day or night, and pretty to explore. \r\n\r\nBe aware that if you come in winter, it gets quite cold. Most apartments in D.F. (including this one) do not have heat, nor insulation. There was one small space heater that helped, but that bare tile floor was always freezing. \r\n\r\nThe hot water is intermittent. The shower will run hot for about 2 minutes, then turn cold. I discovered if you then shut it off, and slowly turn it back on, it will get hot again and stay for the length of your shower.\r\n\r\nThe refrigerator is small, half-sized.. it would be a challenge for more than two people staying there (unless you eat out all the time). \r\nThe apartment was very clean, and the cleaning lady was there to meet me when I arrived. She handed me the keys and left. A bit more of a welcome would have been nice.\r\n\r\nThe beds are comfortable, and there are plenty of closets and big windows. There is no balcony or outside space to hang out. \r\nThe photos of the apartment are accurate. \r\n\r\nNote that the EcoBici shared bike program is only for residents. It's a great system, but cannot be accessed by tourists, as it can be in other cities like London, Paris, New York. \r\n\r\nI never actually met the owner, but she was responsive when I had problems:\r\nMy first few days there were great. Then the internet went out for a day. The next day the electricity went out, and it took 24 hours to get an electrician out to fix it. This was a real bummer, but I can't really fault the owner - I think it was just bad luck, and that could happen almost anywhere. She did refund a portion of one night for my troubles dealing with this. "

We never met Morgana but she arranged for our daughter to meet the housekeeper for the keys and Morgana checked in with me later that first day to make sure that everything was working our for us in the apartment.  The bed in the larger bedroom was quite comfortable.  It was great having a coffee maker in the kitchen and we had all the pots, pans and utensils that we needed.  The Condesa neighborhood where this apartment is located is great - lots of excellent restaurants, coffee houses and shops.  It was also very convenient having the Superama market right across the street which is open until 10 or 11 every night.  We would definitely stay here again."

The neighborhood was great--easy walking to shops and restaurants in Condesa and easy walk to the Bosque de Chapultepec.  It felt like a retreat after our stay in the Centro.\r\n\r\nOnly a few things to be aware of:  it's a bit noisy, though that's to be expected. And the internet connection was fine for one person, but when more than one of us tried to use it, it wasn't really up to the task (though we tend to use high-bandwidth programs--2 people on (Hidden by Airbnb) wouldn't work, but 2 people checking email would).\r\n\r\n"

The place was neat and clean, and the location was perfect for exploring the city.  There is a supermarket right across the street, multiple coffee shops, restaurants, and juice stores located within a block or two, and a great laundromat (Dirty Laundry Cafe & Laundromat) two blocks away. The beds were comfortable enough and the kitchen, while small, had everything one would need for an extended stay. The living room couch was a bit stiff, but I'd hope anyone visiting Mexico City isn't spending much time sitting on the couch in their apartment.\r\n\r\nThe only downside to the place is that it's located on the 4th floor, and there is no elevator. That wasn't a problem for us, but older and/or injured folks or people who plan on carrying around lots of heavy luggage might have an issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is no air conditioning, and while opening the windows quickly and easily cooled the place down, especially at night, it exposed us to the ambient sounds of the neighborhood, which were incredibly noisy-construction, dogs barking, car horns/alarms, people yelling...not a problem at all with the windows closed, but if you like it cool at night/while sleeping I'd recommend bringing some earplugs.

As many of the reviews cite, there are also amazing tacos available right across the street from the building, which we took advantage of on a near daily basis! The neighborhood is safe and as a woman, I had no trouble when taking jogs despite empty streets at early hours. The apartment itself is quaint, with all the amenities you would want and expect from an Airbnb. Morgana was gracious enough to provide water for us, so we were all set for our needs upon arrival. As some mentioned in other reviews - there is a trick to the shower. I found turning it on once (letting it run hot until the water turns cold again), then turning it off - then turning it on a second time, slowly (where only colder water will come out) - then turning off again - and then turning it on for a third time, slowly - would yield hot water that would last the duration of my shower. Another note is the place is very centrally located in terms of taking Ubers around the city. We never paid more than $4 USD for a trip to anywhere we wanted to go - and this was hugely helpful fi0cially for our week long trip. We thank Morgana and her lovely housekeeper for their prompt assistance with any concerns. Would recommend to others!"

The place equipped for a comfortable stay in Mexico City. The living room photos have a bit more details than those actually in the apartment when we went so it wasn't as cozy as it seems; the rooms were were better kept. Keep in mind that the stairs are narrow and there is no elevator when carrying a lot of luggage There was an issue with the electricity during our stay, that I'm assuming it was a one time thing and Morgana seemed very attentive to take care of it.

The location was great and really convenient to all the places we wanted to go. A major park is really close and a nice place to go to take some time out from the huddle and bustle. The metro stations were really close and the ecobici (city bike rental) was just downstairs. We hired bikes the whole time we were there and it was totally worth it! Riding around the areas of la condesa and roma was such a great way to see them. The apartment was just as it looks in the photos. The bed was really comfortable! And the kitchen provided everything we needed to cook if we wanted to. As per some of the other reviews, we had some trouble with the hot water, but turning it on and off three times (as per a previous review) and waiting seemed to work! There was also some trouble with the building electricity where it kept turning on and off but it seemed to be other apartments, not just ours.  Morgana was very prompt in responding to this when we let her know and someone came around to try and fix it. It did not take away from the apartment at all. We would definitely stay here again when we visit Mexico City again!"

We also loved the organic cafe / food store/ restaurant just around the corner ! \nBeing from a very small beach town in Australia we didn't really know what to expect. But we found the area to be quite quant indeed. Not too busy and surprisingly quiet too . No problems sleeping and beds were comfortable. \nWe took advantage of the airport pickup to and from on offer and having surfboards for the latter part of our holiday was no problem as Morgana organised a car to fit all our belongings comfortably.\nCheck in was a breeze and all communication's from Morgana was prompt. \n\nAll in all great stay, great place , great time had and we would definitely stay again ! \n\nThanks again Morgana and Omar ! \n\n"

All the parks are within walking distance. Our kids loved the playgrounds and libraries at Parque Espana and Mexico. The apartment itself is clean, bright and lovely. Morgana and Omar were very responsive. We certainly hope to be back!"

Directly across from a large grocery store, and walking distance from tons of restaurants and a few great public parks.\n\nHosts: They did a good job setting everything up before my arrival, and I never actually had to ask them for anything. But they seemed friendly and ready to help.\n\nApartment: The furnishing is pretty basic, but functional. The mattresses all seemed to be in good condition, and the kitchen had plenty of dishes (and a filtered water dispenser, so no need to buy bottled water). We didn't cook anything during our stay, but there were also pots and pans, knives, etc.\n\nMy only caveat about this unit -- which would apply to most apartments in large cities -- would be: unless you are an extremely sound sleeper, bring earplugs and an eye mask, as the street noise never completely dies down during the night and there are only plastic shades (i.e. no drapes) in the bedrooms."

Everything in the apartment works fine. \r\nLocation is not the trendiest one but it's not far from the citys highlights and there are some shops around. I always took a taxi on my way back home at night as it's not recommendable to walk around this area after 10 pm. However, it feels pretty safe walking around during daylight.  I'll definitely stay there again. \r\n\r\nEstuve casi un mes en este departamento y la pase genial. Esta muy bien equipado y tiene muy buenas vistas de la ciudad de Mexico. Todo en el departamento funciona bien. \r\nLa ubicacion  no es una de las mejores pero no esta lejos de las principales atracciones de la ciudad. He tenido que tomar un taxi en mi vuelta a casa ya que no es recomendable andar a pie por la zona despues de las 10 pm. Igualmente, se siente muy seguro para andar por la zona durante el dia. Definitivamente estaria de nuevo aqui. "

It is a secure, modern building in a good neighborhood in the west of the city with a nice gym and underground parking. The apartment has spectacular views of the city and the surrounding mountains. It is nicely furnished and has new appliances (including washing machine) and reliable high-speed internet (wifi). There is a full (gas) kitchen, full-sized refrigerator, oven, microwave--everything you need or want for short- or long-term stays. \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood has everything you might need within walking distance--grocery stores, oxxo, restaurants, markets, etc. are all nearby. There is a taxi sitio just a block away and the metro station is just a short walk (or a very short bus ride) away as well. From metro Tacuba, it isquick and easy to get anywhere you want to go in or near the city. Some popular sites like Bosque de Chapultapec and the Z\u00f3calo are just a few stops away. \r\n\r\nThe hosts are the nicest people you will ever meet, incredibly helpful and available for anything you might need. They gave me excellent advice about the neighborhood and were always there to help with any questions or problems I had. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend staying in this apartment--I had a fantastic experience. If you stay here, be sure to try the tacos al pastor just down the street--I tried this local specialty several places in DF, and the best I had was right in my own neighborhood! "

Having 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and a comfortable sitting room and kitchen - all for the price of a reasonable hotel room - helped make our vacation a smooth and enjoyable one.\r\nDavid's cousin Wendy checked us in and out at the times we requested, and let us stay late on our checkout day as the apartment was unrented that night.  She couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating.\r\nI'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 primarily for the neighborhood, which was just OK (but subway is only a 10 minute walk).  \r\nI would stay there again in a heartbeat!\r\n\r\n"

Since the valet parking at the apartment was full they helped us get a space at another parking garage just a block and a half from the apartment.  \r\nThe apartment itself was clean and very well stocked.  Mexico city is quite cool this time of year so we were happy to have the area heater that was provided in the apartment.  The security staff at the front desk were always on hand for any questions, or to arrange a taxi.  The location was super convenient for us since we were attending a 3 day convention at the Arena Ciudad de M\u00e9xico stadium, only 15 minutes away.   We would not hesitate to stay here again.  "

I would highly recommend this place, since it is in a safe environment, where it is high security in the building. The only down part is the apartment is a bit far away from the city center. \r\n\r\nWendy was a lovely host, which helped us with any inquiries we may have during our stay. On top of this, David really made sure that we got all the help we needed even when he was in Berlin."

It is very busy in the morning but we found mid afternoon to be a good time. The metro is within walking distance and there are lots of places to eat nearby.

You can buy so many beautiful and traditional things in this market.  The park in front of the apartment is very awesome too. Especially during night, so many people are hanging out there. People do dancing, singing and so many other fun activities in the park. Also, I think Angeles is super hospitable. I enjoy to talk with her about my traveling experience and she gives me a lot of good traveling advices, which were really helpful. Love Mexico City, I will definitely go again! :)"

The flat (apt) was comparable to staying at a 4 star Hotel in America. Well secured with upscale amenities. Angeles comunicated very well in English and respected your privacy with nice personal touches (leaving notes around). I would stay here again if I had to. Angeles, thank you so much for everything and exposing me to some good tasting fruit. Edward from Texas"

Very warm & suggested some great spots for us to eat as well as tips on getting around.\r\n\r\nThe apartment was in a prime spot in Mexico City \u2013\u00a0everything was literally a 5-to-15-minute walk from the apartment: Zocalo, Garibaldi, the Monument to Independence, the museum of Fine Arts...just tons of cool stuff right around the area. Everything was exceptional with regards to the location.\r\n\r\nOne thing that was not mentioned in the apartment description was that Anjal\u00ed teaches yoga classes in her apartment sparingly throughout the week. This wasn't much of a bother, but it definitely made my girlfriend and I less willing to go outside of the room during the time we were home. Very small sidenote, but it definitely had an impact on our overall experience."

Angeles not only made me feel at home but showed me around. \r\nThere are a few fabulous Museums in a short walking distance and food and crafts markets are also very close. For Mexico City that is so large a good location can save you a lot of time.  I would recommend this room to anyone who doesn't want to wast time on unnecessary travels and wants to make most of their trip to this amazing city. The room is really well located, it is clean and comfy and the owner is fabulous person.  Thank you Angeles. I had wonderful time at your place :-)))"

It is very easy to walk down to Reforma, or downtown. Her apartment is very clean so was our room and our private bath. The bed was comfortable for two people. We never cooked or used the kitchen as we ate all our meals outside but everything was very cozy and nice. She even left us fruits. We were out from early morning to late night.\r\n\r\nOn our last day due to a cancellation of a trip at the last minute we did not have much to do, but Angeles after hearing this suggested we visit a small town around 2 hours away from Mexico City and gave us excellent directions. We are so glad that we took her recommendation. She also let us leave out luggage at her apartment and pick it up later at night as we had already checked out and our fight was early morning. She was very kind and helpful.\r\n\r\nThis is a great place to stay for 2 people, I highly recommend Angeles apartment.\r\n\r\n"

She offered me water when I arrived, helped me with getting to the airport, and even invited me to take yoga with her! Her apartment and guest room are very comfortable, and the location couldn't be better--it's easy walking distance from the Palacio de Bellas Artes and Z\u00f3calo, and many metro lines. I would definitely recommend staying there in Mexico City!"

Hopefully Anjali place is available on my next trip to Mexico City."

Overall this is such a great peaceful place in the middle of a busy exciting city. Angeles is delightful and informative. She replied quickly to my many questions as I was preparing to come to Mexico for the first time. I will definitely stay here again if I find myself back in Mexico City!"

She kindly allowed me to take a shower in the swimming pool shower room as the room was not ready yet. Really Thankful! Muchas gracias, Anjali!"

By the way, if you are going to be LOUD after 10 pm, this is probably not the best place as it will interfere with the host's schedule.\n\nAs a bunch of loud dudes, that was a bit tricky. But, on the bright side, it forced us to go to sleep a bit earlier and attend our conference with more energy! \n\nRecommended!"

It was very inconvenient especially because that she didn't give us clear directions at first. 5\uff64The host asked us to tell her when we gonna have showers and she turned off the gas at other time. 6\uff64In our  communication,  the host always just emphasized that she was correct and she did \u201cas we agreed\", but the \"agreement\" only based on her rules and understanding, not mine."

The house is very quiet, nestled in a gated community away from the traffic of Av Universidad, yet only about 7 minutes from the closest metro station (Miguel Angel de Quevedo). The room is spacious and the private bathroom is a rare bonus. You should be comfortable with dogs as Filippa, E and A'd friendly pet, may sometimes be a little over-enthusiastic to see you. I will be back in Mexico City a couple more times and I hope to return to the same place. Thanks to E and A my stay was as pleasant as it could be."

The house is beautiful, comfortable and very quiet, and is located inside a private neighborhood which is very safe.\r\nThe \"Miguel Angel de Quevedo\" metro station is very close, so it was very easy to get to Mexico DF downtown.\r\nEdoardo and Adriana are great people, we loved staying with them. They were very kind and helpful. \r\nI strongly recommend the place because I enjoyed it very much. :)"

They advised me on  where to go and what to see, how to get tickets to the ballet and how to get around safely. In addition they took me to the pyramids and Adriana gave me Spanish lessons - both very reasonably priced and great fun. They are both relaxed and easy people whose company I enjoyed, but they were never intrusive. They speak Spanish, Italian and English proficiently. They are a generous, warm and really helpful people.\r\n\r\nFilippa the dog is really sweet.\r\n\r\nThe house is excellent for a homestay - spacious, comfortable and clean. The kitchen was very well equipped and everything was easy to use. The Wi-Fi worked perfectly. The guest room is upstairs, has its own bathroom, which is a big plus, There is plenty of closet space and a desk. It's a nice, light airy room. And the bed is really comfortable.\r\n\r\nOne of the things I really liked about the house is that it is in a private estate with a locked gate and a concierge. That means you can go out and not worry about laptop, passport, money etc.\r\n\r\nIt's a great location in a number of ways. There's a Walmart up the Road which is just a few minutes away and another down near the Metro which is also in walking distance, plus lots of other smaller shops. There are loads of buses, but I always used the Metro or walked. It's on the boarder between San Angel and Coyoacan, both of which have many attractions. The architecture, the museums, the markets, the shops, parks and squares are fabulous - some of the loveliest in the city. And by Metro, it's easy and quick to get to other parts of the city.\r\n\r\nI felt very comfortable here, Adriana and Eduardo make you feel at home and it's excellent value. I was travelling by myself and I think staying here made that a really good experience.\r\n"

The house is big, well kept and fully equipped with anything you might need or think of.\r\nThe guest room is nice and quiet, perfect if you need to work or write--it  has a desk with chair by the window. The bed is wide and comfortable, with plenty of cushions and pillows, all in excellent status.  I did love the private bathroom, which is fully equipped also with courtesy toiletries, and the wide closet where I could store all my stuff, including the suitcase. \r\nWhen in, I enjoyed having breakfast or lunch in the little patio, doing my Internet with just the sound of the singing birds. I have lived in Mexico City for a few years before so I know how unique this is given the location of the house. Indeed, it is very conveniently located, just behind a busy avenida with taxis and buses running all the time. But you can actually walk to local attactions like Coyoac\u00e1n, go through the little streets, lovely houses and huge trees of this 'barrio', which used to be a village on its own.\r\nAs for the hosts, they are very attentive (for example, when the weather changed, they immediately offered me an extra duvet or a fan, depending on the temperature) and friendly, but also very discrete, so it's up to you to spend some time with them chatting, maybe around a glass of Italian wine. \r\nI would recommend this place to solo travellers as well as couples.\r\n\r\n"

Their house is very spacious and tastefully decorated and we were very happy with our bedroom and bathroom. They were also very flexible with regard to some special needs we had because of our baby. The location was particularly convenient for us, since we were visiting UNAM. The house is about 10 minutes walking distance from one of the entry gates of the university. A supermarket and 7-Eleven are within 5 minutes walking distance. The best thing about staying with Edoardo and Adriana was the relaxed and kind atmosphere. In the evening we often sat together at the living-room table and chatted about all kinds of things and they gave us valuable advice and insights on life in Mexico city. We totally recommend them as hosts!"

La casa nos pareci\u00f3 completamente segura y limpia as\u00ed como el barrio, su cocina est\u00e1 muy bien equipada y es bastante c\u00f3moda, el ba\u00f1o tiene dos entradas, se puede acceder desde dos cuartos pero en general la casa es muy buena.\r\nEdoardo fue amable y respetuoso, nos recomend\u00f3 lugares y nos proporcion\u00f3 toda la informaci\u00f3n que le pedimos. Muy buena experiencia, lo recomiendo totalmente. Gracias Edoardo."

Plus, Edoardo is a very friendly and humble person to talk to, we really enjoyed our conversation with him. Last but not the least, his house is amazing to live in, it's convenient to get access to transportation to all the hot spots in the city. I believe you will have a stunning experience there."

He seems like a fun person and is always attentive to your stay at his place. He made himself available for any possible concerns. He showed me how to operate the washer for laundry that I needed to do and made someone available to pick me up from the airport. The listing is exactly the way that it is listed. The only regret that I have is not getting to know him more. Him and his girlfriend seem like laid back people and are very down to earth. You would be a fool to pass this listing up.

Muy cerca a un bonito centro comercial ( Oasis Coyoac\u00e1n) a un OXXO y a un Wallmart.

The house is within a gated community and so it feels safe and residential. It is also nice and quiet at night for a good night's rest. The metro is about 10-15 minutes walk, so you can easily explore the rest of the city from his place. I was sick while staying there but it was the perfect place for me to rest and recuperate. We didn't see Edoardo much because he was working, but Maria, his partner, was lovely and very friendly. You will feel right at home and comfortable in their lovely and spacious house. Thank you guys!"

About half the time I was there there were two other guests in the other rooms. There was never any conflict sharing the bathroom.\n\nThe kitchen is large and well stocked with pots and pans and dishes. I was given a shelf in the fridge and one in the pantry. There are tons of restaurants within walking distance. Besides al pastor and typical Mexican food there are Chinese, pizza, excellent Japanese, hamburger and a wings restaurant.\n\nI couldn't have asked for more gracious of kind hosts.

Since we were on the go the whole time, we hardly interacted with hosts, but the little that we did they were both really nice people willing to help. Thank you for the local tips Edoardo! We hope to come back soon."

His pets were friendly (they\u2019ll bark at you, but wont bite) His place is close to a subway station and many other ways of transportation. Theres a shopping outside-mall really close by and the neighborhood seems pretty secure. Communication was great and the place was clean and privacy was great. It felt way better than a hotel. I live in Mexico City now but I would 100% recommend this place to any friend or family member that plans to come visit the city."

Many books and novels have been written about it. Actually, even when I have lived here for years, it surprises me very often because it is full of magic and mystery. A really enjoyable place.

The location is terrific - one block to the Metrobus (Hospital General) which makes it really easy to get to the main sites in the centro and is much nicer than taking the metro. There are many cafes and restaurants within walking distance including a good taco stand at the front door plus a pharmacy/general store on the corner. Also quite a big breakfast market a few blocks walk away.\nIsabel is a warm and friendly host who wants to make sure you have everything you need. Isabel got up every morning and made us coffee and gave us lots of good information and advice about the City. She even hung out our washing for us one morning so that we could make an early start sight-seeing! Isabel loves to chat and share experiences - she is very well travelled and speaks 4 languages. We really enjoyed talking to her!\nWe recommend staying with Isabel in Mexico City."

The neighborhood is beautiful and the apartment is very tastefully arranged and extremely clean. I cannot think of a better place to stay when in Mexico City. The room and the Roma Norte neighborhood by themselves deserve 5 stars but Isabel elevated the whole experience by offering excellent suggestions for places to visit, eat and shop. I cannot recommend this place and this host enough. "

Ground floor apartment with ensuite room. 3 min walk takes to red Metrobus stop and then downtown is accessible in 15 min. Uber around 30 min to historic centre. Plenty of uber in the area to find a car any time of the day. Apartment was v nice clean and comfortable. Also a v safe location and next to Condesa which has some great cafes and restaurants. I didn\u2019t want to stay in Downtown so chose this place as downtown noise and crowd wasn\u2019t what I wanted in this trip. Isabel\nwas a superb host and we had many chats about my exploration of Mexico. She was prompt with all communication. She was very kind when I got sick (beware of smoke and air pollution in Mexico - I got cough and allergy from It) and checked on me. Highly recommend."

En el sur de la ciudad de M\u00e9xico, a unas calles del pintoresco pueblo de Tlalpan, casa de dise\u00f1o r\u00fastico mexicano, con mobiliario sencillo. La casa se encuentra dividida en dos secciones: la casa familiar en la planta baja, y el \u00e1rea de hu\u00e9spedes en la Planta alta, para viajeros que buscan tranquilidad y privacidad, tanto en estancias cortas como largas. Los hu\u00e9spedes cuentan con internet inal\u00e1mbrico y una peque\u00f1a cocineta exclusiva para su uso, equipada con refrigerador, horno de microondas, licuadora, tostador, cafetera, fregadero y alacenas. Los colchones son rigurosamente desinfectados a vapor, para mayor seguridad de nuestros hu\u00e9spedes. Dado que se trata de una casa familiar y nos gusta que nuestros hu\u00e9spedes gocen de privacidad, las \u00e1reas que pueden utilizar son el corredor que le da acceso a las habita",
          "neighborhood_overview": "El Barrio del Ni\u00f1o Jes\u00fas, aunque con el tiempo ha adquirido un aspecto moderno, fue fundado hace m\u00e1s de 400 a\u00f1os, por lo que conserva cierto sabor antiguo. Muy cerca de nuestro Barrio, est\u00e1 situado el Centro de Tlalpan. Es una lugar tambi\u00e9n muy antiguo y a\u00fan conserva sus casonas coloniales.  Es muy pintoresco y se puede ir a tomar caf\u00e9 o simplemente a disfrutar de su plaza.  Se pueden ver comentarios de los visitantes en: (URL HIDDEN)",
          "notes": "Por falta de capacidad nos es imposible que los hu\u00e9spedes usen la lavadora; sin embargo, a s\u00f3lo dos casas de aqu\u00ed, se ofrece este servicio a precios muy razonables.",

Hay dos formas de acceder a los principales transporte colectivos de la ciudad que son el Metrob\u00fas y el Metro y que se trasladan a las zonas mencionadas arriba.  Al Metrob\u00fas se puede llegar incluso cami0do, y al Metro, tomando un microb\u00fas. El tiempo estimado para llegar a la estaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s cercana es de apr\u00f3ximadamente 25 o 30 minutos, dependiendo del tr\u00e1fico.",

Los hu\u00e9spedes cuentan con internet inal\u00e1mbrico. As\u00ed mismo, les ofrecemos una cocineta exclusiva para ellos (en donde, si desean uso de ella, deber\u00e1n hacerse cargo de la limpieza); aclaramos que NO ES APTA PARA COCINAR, s\u00f3lo para calentar o preparar alimentos sencillos; est\u00e1 equipada con refrigerador, horno de microondas, licuadora, tostador, cafetera, fregadero y alacenas (NO CUENTA CON ESTUFA O FOG\u00d3N).

Ellos en realidad son los que definen la relaci\u00f3n, y \u00e9sta puede ser muy cercana, o simplemente respetuosa, aunque nunca distante, pues estamos muy pendientes de la seguridad y las necesidades de los viajeros. Nuestros hu\u00e9spedes nos han comentado que la diferencia de \"nuestro lugar\", es la privacidad y la tranquilidad que se respira dentro de nuestra casa.

Muy buena comunicacion, logistica, la habitaci\u00f3n muy comoda, limpia y bonita. Me apoyaron y brindaron consejos de como poder moverme en Mexico DF. Les recomiendo alojarse con Eugenia la locaci\u00f3n es bastante segura. Hay un restaurante cercano donde puedes comer tacos y te puedes ir cami0do al centro de tlalplan a hacer tu mercado, tienes cerca tiendas de conveniencia. Si eres personal de salud que viene hacer una rotacion clinica a los hospitales te queda super cerca te puedes ir cami0do al psiquiatrico, cancerologia o el zubiran. Espero regresar pronto.  Muchas gracias por todo Eugenia."

I stayed in the one bedroom and shared one bathroom with another renter.\r\n\r\nThroughout my stay Eugenia made sure that I had everything I needed. Since I arrived with an ankle injury she was extra helpful to make sure I was comfortable and didn't re-injure myself.\r\n\r\nThere were other medical students that stayed there while I lived at Eugenia's. Everyone was respectful of common spaces and everyone was friendly.\r\n\r\nThe area was also very pleasant. I never felt unsafe in the neighborhood. Her house is at the end of a cul-de-sac and it is very quiet. Two doors down you can drop-off laundry and purchase water and other snacks. Two blocks away is a main thoroughfare where you can find a convenience store and a decent gym.\r\n\r\nThe house is near all hospitals in the area as well as downtown Tlalpan. In downtown Tlalpan you can find a lively town square with a traditional Mexican market, a church, and several cafes, restaurants, bars and bookstores. \r\n\r\nI would stay there again if I needed to and I would definitely recommend it to a friend. \r\n\r\n-H"

Es una familia que te ofrece todo su apoyo para que pases una estancia donde tus preocupaciones solo sean aquellas cosas que no tengan que ver con el lugar donde te hospedas; adem\u00e1s, te hacen sentir como parte de su familia. \r\nEl valor agregado de la casa es que te proporciona mucha tranquilidad ya que su hubicaci\u00f3n permite sentirte lejos del bullicio. Adem\u00e1s, est\u00e1 a unos pasos del centro de Tlalpan, un lugar encantador donde puedes pasar unas tardes llenas de algarab\u00eda, de la plaza al caf\u00e9, del caf\u00e9 al restaurante y con fortuna te encuentras con alg\u00fan festival. \r\nYo, sinceramente recomiendo este lugar..."

Their house and the room I stayed in was beautiful, well maintained, and very comfortable. Eugenia is a lovely, sweet woman who really helped my transition to Mexico be easy and fun, and she always gave me excellent advice on how to get around, what to do, where to go, etc. It was great staying with her and her family who were always very kind and helpful but very respectful of my schedule and my space. I can't thank them enough for everything they did for me during my stay and would highly recommend their place to anyone!"

Nunca me falto lo indispensable en cuesti\u00f3n de papel de ba\u00f1o, toallas, luz o agua caliente. \r\nAunque no coincid\u00edamos mucho por los horarios, pod\u00eda platicar y hacer las preguntas necesarias en el momento que lo requer\u00eda, y al mismo tiempo, respetaron siempre mi privacidad y horarios. \r\n\r\nMe toco la oportunidad de estar cuando fue el cumplea\u00f1os de dos de los anfitriones, y  fui invitada a su celebraci\u00f3n y pasamos una muy agradable tarde. \r\n\r\nLa cocina contiene lo esencial para uno. un microondas, tostadora, licuadora, exprimidor de jugos, y refrigerador. si en alg\u00fan momento necesitaba algo m\u00e1s, solo lo necesitaba pedir. \r\n\r\nEl cuarto es espacioso,  la cama es individual y c\u00f3moda, tienes suficiente espacio para colocar toda la ropa que necesites y hasta m\u00e1s.  un escritorio de trabajo, una escalera de caracol, por la cual subes al ba\u00f1o,  a otro cuarto (que puede rentarse para para parejas / amigos que viajan juntos o no rentarse como en mi caso y tener un cuarto extra) a un \"estudio\" en donde se tiene una cafetera, una mesa con sillas y un div\u00e1n, en donde se puede trabajar muy agusto o simplemente leer un rato. \r\n\r\nLa casa esta muy bien cuidada y arreglada, la entrada a los cuartos es pr\u00e1cticamente independiente, cruza uno el patio e inmediatamente sube a los cuartos. de esa manera no se interrumpe la din\u00e1mica familiar y uno puede subir y bajar cuantas veces quiera sin problema. \r\nRealmente, me quedo con una gran impresi\u00f3n de mi estancia, y definitivamente si regreso pronto al sur de la ciudad de M\u00e9xico, contactar\u00e9 nuevamente a Eugenia. \r\n\r\nAmpliamente Recomendado. \r\n"

I think this is the best apartment I have stayed in Mexico City, near parks, cafes, restaurants and bars. It's just a few blocks away from Tamaulipas, which is a street that has lots of fun places to eat and hang out and from \"Parque Espa\u00f1a\" . Another thing that I really liked was the terrace. At night I was able to enjoy it, which was very relaxing. I will definitely stay here again and I highly recommend it!"

The neighborhood is fabulous with two gorgeous parks close by and the apartment is to die for-- complete with a beautiful rooftop terrace on top of your own private balcony.  Sandro made us feel SO welcome.... pan, jam\u00f3n, queso y cerveza waiting for us in the fridge and he even gave us a local cell phone to use for a few days!!  Beyond amazing.  We were ready to rent out the place forever.  Thanks so much Sandro!  I can't wait to come back to the DF y La Condesa!  "

He went so far beyond what was necessary, you know he simply loves hosting people, and his place would be a bargain at more than twice what he is charging.  He was out of the country when we were visiting, and his communication was still excellent.  The property is just a delight to live in, many hours spent on the terrace.  There is a taxi stand just out the door, but you can easily spend all day here and feel quiet in the middle of the city.  There is also an onsite manager as the city was doing something with the water system, but between Sandro and the manager everything was always taken care of.  Condesa is far and away the most beautiful area of the city, looking more like Barcelona, and with lots of amazing original Deco.  Great little block minutes away (Colima and Av Sonora) where you can drop laundry and some food and a great ice cream stand.  Mexico City is really under-valued as a tourist destination, and for this reason it is a perfect getaway from the US, very close, and not FULL of American tourists.  It is authentically Mexican, and there is far too much to do to fill a week or even a month, but this apartment will very much give you that experience of living in a beautiful neighborhood.  There is no other place in the city I would consider staying.  From being a manager myself, communication, both from the guest and from the owner, are the keys to a perfect stay.  Sandro has it together and will attend to anything.  "

The night we arrived, he walked several blocks to find our shuttle driver who refused his directions, and helped us carry our baggage up the stairs.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is wonderfully appointment, and Sandro even left a few special touches that were a great surprise.  The balcony and rooftop terrace were pleasant to sit on, as it barely felt as if you were in such a large city.  The location is excellent for tourists, with a sitio taxi stand at the end of the alley; a short 10 minute walk to the Chapultepec or Seville metro stations. 10-15 minute walk to Bosque de Chapultepec, 15-20 minutes to the center of Zona Rosa, and 10 minutes to the center of Condesa, where there is a large selection of restaurants of all types and price ranges. There is a 7-11 right across the street, as well as numerous vendors on the surrounding blocks with great offerings for juice, breakfast, tortas, tacos, flowers and more.\r\n\r\nSandro was available and attentive, without being in any way intrusive. An excellent host, and we would definitely consider staying in his apartment again should we return to Mexico City."

Sandro was easily accessible and responsive by phone.  He had lost our cell phone while in transit, and he was kind enough to lend us one already loaded with some minutes.  What a lifesaver! Another advantage of the apartment is an official sitio taxi stand across the street from the apartment.  We had an extremely early flight from Mexico City, and we were able to get a safe and reliable cab to the airport at 3 AM for 150 pesos.  Talk about convenience!  We are looking forward to a return to Mexico City, and Sandro's apartment will be our first choice."

The apartment itself is beautiful, airy with high ceilings and plenty of light. Decorated with modern paintings and filled with art & design books. This is a great place to get work done or relax on the balcony or rooftop terrace. The apartment has a full kitchen and gas stove should you want to cook and stay in. The balcony adjoins the apartment and provides nice backdrop for dining al fresco. This is a gorgeous property, which exceeded our expectations. It is incredibly quiet and peaceful.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is tucked away at the end of a small street in a secure location in a renovated property with friendly neighbors and plenty of privacy.

He also left us some beer, bread, cheese and ham in the fridge, which we enjoyed. During our trip the water was shut off by the city (not Sandro's fault). Sandro was very attentive. He called to have a truck of water delivered to the building at midnight on a Sunday night. I highly recommend this apartment. Just be sure you are very particular in noting the address. The apartment is located on a quiet alley. Our taxi driver couldn't find it. Neither could a tour guide who picked us up for a trip to the pyramids. Fortunately Sandro saw us circling around in a taxi the night we arrived and flagged us down."

He was there to meet us on arrival & showed us around the apartment. He left us a welcome pack of food & drinks. He checked in during our visit to make sure we were comfortable. Very fast responses via text messages. Highly recommended for your stay in this great city."

He gave us a Mexican cell phone which we could e.g. use to contact him in case of issues (...which we did not have :)). We met Sandro only on arrival which is absolutely positive since there is nothing worse than a host who is present all the time.  \r\n\r\nThe apartment itself was clean and beautiful - just as on the pictures. We only used it for sleeping, but there has been a nice Kitchen, Cable-TV, WiFi and many other amenities.\r\n\r\nAt the end of our journey we had one more night in Mexico City for which we booked an expensive Hotel near Zocalo. Let me tell you that Sandro's apartment as well as the neighbourhood with all its restaurants, bars and nightlife in walking distance was soooo much better!\r\n\r\nYou should definitely book this apartment if you are going to stay in Mexico City!"

A taxi stand is essentially across the street for ease of access to the airport, and booking can be done in English, which put our minds at ease. Thanks, Sandro, for being so attentive. \r\n"

The location is great, with easy access to everything that Condesa and Roma have to offer, as well as easy accessibility to public transport, including a taxi stand adjacent to the building.  Sandro was a very prompt communicator who told me everything I needed to know pre-arrival, including a detailed map for the cab driver. I was also very impressed with the beer and food that he presented to me on my arrival! Sandro was also very responsive during my stay, coming to the apartment to help with a minor tv problem (which turned out to just be 'user error'...). Highly recommended! "

He was an excellent host and made sure that we were comfortable with the apartment and the surrounding area. On that note, the apartment is very convenient to area restaurants, nightlife, etc., and if you need to take a taxi there is a sitio right across the street that always had cabs available. Moreover, Sandro left a local cell phone, allowing us to make reservations, call taxis (as well as get in touch with him if needed.) The pictures of the space itself are accurate - it is an airy, well-thought out studio apartment, perfect for one or two people. It had been about 10 years since I had been in Mexico City and much has changed - for the better!  I highly recommend a visit and a stay at Sandro's place in Condesa."

For instance, from the bed, you don't see the kitchen area.\r\n- the small balcony. Even though I could not use it, due to bad weather, this is a rarity in Mexico City\r\n- very very quiet, as the apt is in a building at the end of a small alley\r\n- good location: easy to get by foot to nicer areas of Condesa, and proximity to main Sonora Ave and Durango street makes it very easy to get a taxi\r\n- tasteful design, high ceilings (also a rarity in Mex City)\r\n- good HD TV \r\n- Sando was a very forthcoming host, and also flexible as regards arrival or departure times.\r\n\r\nWhat I liked less:\r\n- the apt is poorly insulated so you hear almost every step (and voice) of the neighbours the floor above\r\n- if you have a car, access to the garage is quite difficult due to the location of the building, so if you thought of renting a car: get a small one.\r\n\r\nOverall: highly recommended for a couple or single traveller."

Fast WiFi and great cable with lots of English channels.\r\n\r\nOne drawback, like other apartments I've stayed at in Mexico City, the hot water comes in waves and in a limited quantity. There is no on site laundry, so I was advised to go to a nearby laundry service but their hours of 9-6 were not good for business travelers."

The Park Chapultepec, and even the Zocalo were walking distance, depending on how much you like to walk. \r\nThe apartment itself was lovely, clean and light filled. The bathroom is big, and there's a lovely balcony where you can take your morning coffee. There's a 7-11 right around the corner for your essential needs. More importantly, there's a taxi stand right there so you don't have to worry about getting a cab.\r\nSandro was a fantastic host. He'd thought of everything, from printing bilingual directions from the airport to the apartment to bringing us bread and ham. He was there to receive us and gave us a mobile phone. \r\nThis was an amazing experience. We can't wait to go back. We'd definitely stay with Sandro again. \r\n\r\n"

Before we arrived, Sandro provided flawless directions to his apartment which otherwise can be kind of confusing since it's located at the end of a private street. We were greeted promptly and he brought drinks and snacks for us to have during our stay. He even let us use a small cell phone which had several taxi numbers pre-programmed, making life much easier. The bed was comfortable and the kitchen well equiped and the fridge had tons of sodas and some beer when we arrived! The TV has 500+ channels and there's a DVD player as well. My only gripe was we would have liked more bath towels but that was kind of our fault, we should have scheduled a cleaning during our 9 day stay. \r\n\r\nThere is a taxi stop right across the street so there's always a safe taxi waiting right outside your door!! Along with a 7-eleven right across the street. There are several metro stops within walking distance and we easily walked to Chapultepec park (castle, anthropology & Modern art museum)  from the house. \r\n\r\nAlso, there's an amazing little cafe at the entrance to the private street that's open M-F 7-7 and serves the best coffee and chilaquiles not to mention wonderful service. We ate there nearly every day, and were sad to leave. On our next visit we would ABSOLUTELY stay here again. \r\n\r\nThanks again Sandro!"

Communications with Sandro were excellent and easy; he was very accessible and responsive by phone and e-mail throughout my stay, although we never met.  His colleague, Lalo, met me at the apartment and checked me out at the end.  Lalo was lovely and helpful.  The apartment is pretty much as pictured and described.  Perfect for one or a couple.  Pitter patter of little feet from the flat above, but it never bothered me, and the parents of the youngster upstairs were really delightful.  Generally, I found the apartment perfect for my needs, kitchen had everything I needed when I felt like cooking; all in all the apartment is quite comfortable, simply but attractively decorated, good wifi, cable tv with good music channels, a nice little balcony.  The neighborhood was just right for me.  Easy access to leafy Condessa, 15 minute walk to the newly hip part of Roma Norte, also short walk to Reforma and Chapultapec.   I look forward to returning whenever possible.  "

Lalo also went above and beyond the call of duty: when I arrived, and I mentioned that I wanted to visit the grocery store, he not only drove me there but insisted on paying for my groceries (initial start-ups like coffee and eggs and cereal). Also, the apartment was well-stocked with wine and beer, and the cell phone was topped off with 300 pesos. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is exactly as advertised, facing an interior courtyard. The WiFi worked perfectly. The balcony and the living room are very comfortable, and the ability to open the balcony doors brings in lots of light and fresh air. The hot water arrives rapidly, and Lalo responded very quickly one day when the water was shut off, piping in a private supply of water to the apartment so we would not be without (water shut-offs are common in that part of Mexico City, and not at all Sandro or Lalo's fault). The apartment complex is very secure and quiet at night; its location down an large-ish alley insulates it from street noise. The neighborhood is also fantastic, one of the trendiest in Mexico City--  there are nice bars, restaurants, and yoga studios within walking distance, and the area is very safe for walking around late at night. The taxi stand across the street is very convenient, and the metro is a ten minute walk away.  \r\n\r\nI will definitely stay here again!"

The apartment is well-appointed, clean, cozy, sunny, and stocked with pretty much everything you need. The location is a major plus -- it's a 10-minute walk from the pink Metro line, the Insurgentes Metrobus line, and the Reforma bus, which together get you pretty much anywhere you need to go (and there's a taxi stand across the street for the rest). There is no street noise of any kind, and limited noise from the upstairs neighbours. Sandro provided both a landline telephone and a cellphone for my use during my stay, which was great.  The only down-side was the periodic water shortages, but these were mostly resolved quickly, and Sandro and Lalo were very responsive when these occurred.

The photos of his apartment were very accurate and beautiful.  When he arrived at the airport in Mexico City, we telephoned Sandro as previously arranged.  He told us that Lalo would meet us outside the apartment, which he did.  Lalo is incredible: He is kind, friendly, helpful, generous, and always available.  He showed us around the apartment, showed us where things were and how to use them, what to do, where to go, how to get there etc.\n\nLater, when we encountered an issue with which we need help, Lalo was there for us, solving the problem!\n\nThe apartment itself is great and the photos of it are accurate.  It is very WELL LOACTED!  Right in the heart of Condessa, a neighborhood which is very interesting, safe, and extremely well positioned to go to other areas of the city.  The apartment itself is in a newly renovated building in an ally off of\nGuadalajara Ave.  The ally makes the apartment very quiet as there is NO traffic at all.  In addition, and you can see this from Sandro,s photos, the apartment faces the interior courtyard, which is beautifully landscaped.  The fact that the apartment faces the interior makes it even more peaceful and quiet.  This makes the apartment unique, as the noise of Mexico City streets can NOT be heard at all.\n\nI love this apartment because of its simplicity, its modern design using some old architectural features, its simplicity, its location etc.  It is very comfortable.\n\nGiven its location, its beauty, the fact that it faces an internal courtyard, the fact that it is in Condessa (extremely pleasant with a real neighborhood feel), and given the kindness and helpfulness of both Sandro and Lalo, I HIGHLY recommend Sandro,s apartment.\n"

Our experience was enhanced by Lalo's hospitality - greeting us on arrival, sharing recommendations on local restaurants and even dropping us at the airport (as he was already going that way). \nIn short, this is a great apartment in a prime location with exceptionally helpful and professional hosts. I highly recommend this apartment!"

When we arrived, we had one of his business partners, Lalo, greet us. Lalo was incredibly friendly; he bought us water, recommended bars and restaurants, told us to give him a call if we needed anything (he was sincere), and provided us a cell phone on behalf of the property.\r\n\r\nThe property itself is beautiful. Exactly like the pictures. High ceilings, comfortable bed and couch, plenty of light. There is a small wooden balcony that overlooks a small complex (about 5-10 other apartments). All the other balconies are very verdant. Overall, very cute.\r\n\r\nAlso, in an amazing location. Right near the Anthropological Museum, several parks, and plenty of great restaurants and bars. La Condesa is a really cool neighborhood that doesn't feel touristy. Quiet and peaceful, but there are places that have bars that really pop off.\r\n\r\nDefinitely recommended."

If you want to explore other parts of the city, there is a \"sitio\" or radio taxi stand across the street and the metro is only a 10 minute walk.  Lalo was so helpful when we arrived, explaining the neighborhood and giving us restaurant recommendations.  The fridge was stocked with soda and beer, and he even went out of his way to buy us some Pan de Muerto which is a seasonal delicacy.  Anyone considering a trip to Mexico City should stay in this beautiful and quiet apartment!  We loved it!"

The apartment had a stocked fridge with beer, soda, water free of charge. There was also fresh fruit on the table for us. All of these extra items were unexpected and greatly appreciated.

He also gave me his contact info and a local mobile phone to use if I needed anything.  Sandro was also accessible by phone and we were in contact before I arrived in Mexico City.  This extra support was a nice touch :)   \r\n\r\nLa Condesa is a quaint neighbourhood with lots of green space like tree lined walking trails and a popular dog park. It also has a ton of restaurants and bars located close to the apartment.  Other nearby areas of interest include the local zoo (free and with pandas!), the Chapultepec Castle and the Museo Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda.

There is nearby access to subway stations, allowing you to access the rest of the city very easily! The building has a doorman and has secure entry, making you feel safe and secure. The noise level was quiet most of the time, minus some noise coming from the family living upstairs. The check-in and check-out process was very easy! Sandro's business associate, Lalo, met us at the apartment and welcomed us with beer, water, bread, and fruit, which was such a nice treat after a long day of travel! All in all, a great experience!

You can easily walk to all the wonderful restaurants, bars, shopping and parks in Roma and Condesa, a taxi stand is across the street (near a convenient 7-11), metro station a few blocks aways, and the neighborhood is beautiful. The apartment itself is clean, quiet (thanks to it's side street location), comfortable and has all the little things you might need (hair dryer, extra blankets, a fan and heater, all kitchen tools, etc.) Our arrival and departure went smoothly, and there were lovely flowers, pastries, beer, fruit and bottled water already there for us.

This was our first trip to Mexico City (30M population!) and Sandro helped us in planning our vacation continually by sending us maps, taxi info, etc. whenever we inquired. When we arrived in the City Sandro's friend/assistant, Lalo provided the keys and more detailed info on the apartment, and the Condesa neighborhood.  The apartment had been stocked with bottled water, fresh fruit, pastries, and a vase full of flowers.  What a wonderful welcome!"

Nice little kitchen that was totally stocked with everything you would need to cook meals. Bathroom was great. Very nice hot water. Had no problems with water at all. The tub is small but fine for showering. Nice tv and dvd player. Internet was great. They had the username and password ready for us when we arrived. There is a gated entrance so you feel very safe. One of the great things about the apartment was the silence at night. My wife and I have traveled quite a bit in central and South America. Great weather but that tends to mean very little insulation. Any outside noise is going to come in. This place was great. You could hear life during the day, but it was normal levels of activity but at night it was totally quiet from about 10pm to 7am. That was wonderful! They had bottled water, fresh fruit, fresh pastries, fresh cut flowers for us when we arrived! There is a doorman there from 7am-6pm. His name was Luis. Very nice young man. The location: it really can't get much better than this. This was my wife and my first time in Mexico City. The apartment is situated ideally. You can walk all over the place and feel totally safe. Some of the things that we loved: flower kiosks with incredibly cheap prices (my wife loves calla lilies - in the states these can range from $4-$7/stem but we found them for 35 pesos for ten! The exchange rate was 16.5pesos/$1! So basically $2.25 for ten! And they were huge. Needless to say I looked like a hero to my wife and it barely cost me), local restaurants everywhere, panaderias (fresh baked bread stores with fresh pastries - breakfast every morning - delicious but horrible for the (Website hidden by Airbnb) was worth it), subway about 4 blocks away ($0.33/ride - yes that is right, thirty three cents, 5 pesos, to ride the subway - and it can take you anywhere), uber taxis - if you don't have the uber app get it, it can't be any easier. You set your account up on your phone. When you are ready for a taxi you open the app and request an uber. They always picked us up in less than 4min! When you are done the fare is charged automatically to the card on the account - always fair, always honest. We would normally head out in the morning and use the subway and hiking to get anywhere. Then when we were tired at night we would get an uber back. Sandro: Sandro communicated in a great way. Always responded to questions. Set things up for us so that when we arrived someone was there to get us the keys. Overall an excellent experience. My brother and his wife live inMexico city so they know the area very well.

I'm reaching, because he really does provide the amenities that make a stay comfortable.\r\n\r\n t  he location is superb.  the support network is great, from the gentleman who meets you and can lug your bags up the stairs effortlessly (good for advanced age clients), and the lovely lady we met who cleans the place.More than just good value- a rare find! \r\n\r\n (Website hidden by Airbnb) \r\n"

The neighborhood is amazing - with a lot of bars and restaurants at a walkable distance. We always felt very safe to walk around, even at night. We joined Ecobici to explore the city by bike - one of the bike stations is just around the corner of Sandro's house. If you visit Mexico City go to Sandro's place!"

The neighborhood is tranquil and a few steps in every direction there are good places to eat, drink and enjoy. Sandro's assistant Renata met us upon arrival and was very sweet, offering us pan dulce and explaining everything we needed to know to be comfortable. After traveling within and beyond Mexico City each day it was really nice to come back to the comfortable couch and bed, and to enjoy airy living room. Sandro was very responsive and checked in with us from the moment we chose the listing, until the day we left. I plan to stay here again. "

The directions, the quick responses to questions, the neighborhood, the apartment and building were all as expected and pleasant. \r\n\r\nWe particularly liked the size of the kitchen so we could prepare meals there and with the short distance to a great grocery store, it was a perfect way to save money and not eat out for every meal. It is important to note that Mexico does pastries and breads better than most and Pasteler\u00eda Suiza is on the way to the supermarket. \r\n\r\nAlthough the bedroom does not have its own private room, it is dark enough that the morning sun does not wake you up; that was a pleasant surprise. There is sufficient closet space and the bathroom is very large but could simply use a chair or bench for changing or hanging clothes.\r\n\r\nThe balcony is not private but is perfect for Mexico City weather and we could enjoy time sitting out and relaxing with a cup of coffee, tea, and sweet breads provided by Sandro. In addition, the living area was equally comfortable and the TV worked well and had music stations available as well as many different channels. \r\n\r\nFinally, the neighborhood is safe and fun and a fairly central location for many day trips and museum/history excursions. If you wanted to stay in town, there is so much to do with Chapultepec Park right next door, the park's museums or the many restaurants nearby. It is really a convenient area.\r\n\r\0d, of course, the place was clean; that is important. We enjoyed ourselves so much that we hope to return before too long, stay at Sandro's place and see the many places we missed.\r\n\r\nIt is a wonderful price and place; we highly recommend it. \r\n\r\n"

At the intersection of Condesa and Roma Norte, we were a quick walk or Uber anywhere in the city.  "

He kindly offered to a pick-up from the airport and gave us information about the apartment and surrounding area.  \r\n\r\nPros: \r\nThe apartment is in a residential neighborhood - in walking distance to stores, restaurants, parks, etc. The kitchen is well equipped, and there are great restaurants such as Contramar and Lardo (lunch/dinner) as well as Lalo! (brunch), which are worth a visit. There is a great coffee shop across the street and a taco stand called Tacos Hola not too far away. As far as nightlife - a mezcaleria La Clandestina and club Rhodesia are recommended. Uber offers a cheap and safe way to move around the city - no need to use public transport. \r\n\r\nCons:\r\nThe noise levels were higher than expected both due to the apartment facing a courtyard, the upstairs neighbors, and it being located in an alley used by residents of other buildings. Also keep in mind that the apartment is bright, especially in the mornings and plan accordingly if light is an issue during sleep.  The bed is rather springy, for those used to more of a memory foam experience. Lastly, the water pressure in the bathroom sink leaves more to be desired as it was mostly trickling and light bulbs in various places in the apartment kept going out during our stay. "

There's a central garden space that added greenery to our stay and a small balcony to enjoy it. I wanted a place close to where our friends were staying and when I wrote to Sandro he sent me a map showing we were two blocks away. That was just the beginning of his (and his team's) helpfulness. We were welcomed with fruit and pastries and coffee for the morning. \r\nThe location in Condesa is excellent. The street is a privada and is just as it sounds, off the main street and quiet and also secure. Overall a terrific experience and I look forward to staying there again on my next visit to the city.  \r\n "

We loved the location, very walkable within La Condesa and La Roma, the two neighborhoods we spent the most time in. A short (and inexpensive!) Uber ride to anywhere else in the city. The apartment is the perfect size 2 travelers. We loved that it was in a quieter part of the city and set back from the street so that we were able to enjoy some solitude at the end of each day. Can be a little bit loud on the weekend (as normal in any big city)  with slightly thin walls but nothing too bothersome at all. Sandro is a wonderful host who is very prompt in communication and provided so many recommendations. "

The space itself was exactly what we needed for our stay with a little private outdoor balcony, instant coffee and a kitchen, a comfortable bed, and some charming green tile. \n\nSandro was attentive, emailing to check in on us a few times, and quick to respond to any questions. We'd definitely stay there again."

First off, communication with the owner was top notch (something that is very important to me). The condition of the apartment was exactly a described and did not have any problems with any of the amenities whatsoever. I did notice that a few of the previous reviewers mentioned that hot water would run out rather quickly while showering, but we never ran into this problem while staying there.\nWe were also very happy with the neighborhood in which the apartment is located. Its tree-lined streets, along with nearby promenades made this a very pedestrian friendly neighborhood. There are also a variety of local cafes and restaurants to grab breakfast, lunch, or dinner to satisfy your taste buds. \nThe apartment is also located to nearby public transportation if you feel adventurous enough to use it. It could be daunting at first, but it\u2019s worth if you want to avoid city traffic during peak hours (and paying only 5 pesos for the Metro is a big bonus!). There is also a taxicab stand right across the street if you ever need one.  The apartment is also located near the Bosque de Chapultepec and Angel de la Independencia which was a huge plus for me! \nOverall, this was a great place to stay and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a clean, safe and quiet stay in CDMX! \n"

But the hosts provide a map and directions and once you get there the location is easy to find. I was working remotely from the apartment and the internet was very fast. The apartment however, is not ideal if you are looking for peace and quiet. The walls must be thin and the glass doors don\u2019t seal tightly. We were woken up with a neighbor\u2019s baby crying some mornings, and another neighbor\u2019s dog would bark while they were gone, and a feral cat yowling in the courtyard.

Check-in was a breeze. Thoroughly enjoyed the small bakery on our alley - though not a commercial one - they sold the extra baked goods that weren't sold to restaurants which were delicious!   My husband enjoyed the barber shop and received his first official \"shave\" in a chair from Raquel at Unica.. Walking to the local restaurants and down Calle de Amsterdam was lovely. Maximo is nearby - beautiful restaurant and delicious -great lounging bar upstairs. Overall - CDMX was lovely - people friendly and relaxed. We plan on returning for a longer stay next time..Highly recommend Sandro and Ines's place."

Most importantly, they were kind and thoughtful in a variety of ways. If we needed suggestions for anything, they would help us quickly.

This makes getting around to all the CDMX \"musts\" extremely easy- like Castillo de Chapultepec &Barragan, etc. Had we not come for adventure, we would have had plenty to do/ see/ eat in their area alone. We LOVED Lardo, drinks on the roof of Hotel Condesa, Galibier Cycling House, & Kura (\"best Japanese in the city\")- all within just a couple blocks of their spot. Sandro & Ines provided a great locals guide upon arrival, as well as helpful transportation instructions. We never felt unsafe once. Lastly, the apartment itself is hidden within a beautiful building featuring a gorgeous garden view, very clean and offered with extra linens, towels etc...not to mention the fresh flowers. I can't think of a better deal than all of that! Salute!"

However, we feel the way In which they handled the situation is worth sharing. When we arrived at their place and discovered there was no water, they didn't hesitate to put us up in a hotel. And not just any hotel -- NH Collection with breakfast included. When it was confirmed that the water would not be back the next day, they put us up for a second night. When the water hadn't been restored by the end of the second day, and not knowing how long the situation would continue, they offered us the option to cancel with a refund for the remaining 4 days of our booking. Throughout, Alex communicated with us regularly and was totally transparent about the details of the cancellation/refund. I feel that not every host would have chosen the type of hotel Sandro and Ines did. To us, that demonstrated their generosity and a genuine desire to ensure we had a comfortable and enjoyable stay in Mexico City. In conclusion, we would not hesitate to stay at their bnb on our next trip to CDMX. They embody the idea of a\"super host.\""

Overall we did okay here, but I wouldn\u2019t book it again. \n\nThere were a few things I wanted to note that need to be addressed:\n- the soap had been previously used, no shampoo and conditioner was available\n- the balcony and railing are in poor condition and are not safe for children \n- the place was generally not very clean, especially the bathroom which had hair and nail clippings, also the dirty mop cloth was left hanging in there\n- it would be great to have water service with a 5 gallon jug \n\nWe have traveled in Mexico before and know that you have to adjust your expectations; I have taken this into account :) I\u2019m giving my honest review because I think people deserve it.

I am a part-time resident of Mexico and have a house in a city 3 hours away. Sandro is an excellent communicator, the apartment generally has a good aesthetic and good architecture. And it\u2019s a great location that feels safe. Unfortunately, after my last 3 night stay, I must agree with the last reviewer\u2019s honest and accurate criticisms. A large, extended family has apparently moved into the adjacent apartment. The noise from that apartment reverberated throughout the small courtyard until well after midnight each night. It gets really loud at times. I would also agree that there are some quality control issues with whoever is cleaning the apartment. Furthermore, the balcony floorboards are loose and appear to be rotting. In any case, what used to be a pleasant, quiet spot for enjoying morning coffee no longer feels  pleasant, quiet or even safe. My previous reviews of Sandro\u2019s apartment have all be very positive. In fairness to Airbnb users,  I am sad that I can no longer give this apartment the high rating it once deserved."

The level of cleanliness and lack of amenities would make me rate it a little lower.  Unfortunately there were a few negative things that were out of the host's control, but that affected our overall experience.  The host was very attentive, though, when the issue came up.  The building can get pretty loud, but if you're mostly out and about it won't be a huge disturbance.  All in all, location was great, we loved the terrace, and the bakery downstairs has delightful treats with very nice people!  I think based on really great reviews, I was expecting more, but I'm not sure what all that would be.  There are other places in the area for less and if you're spending most of your time away from the place I might opt for that.  It is a cute, charming spot, though and at the end of the day we definitely enjoyed ourselves because Mexico City is an amazing city, not much can bring you down!"

It\u2019s central to everywhere you want to be while having a quiet residential feel. Great restaurants and bars are a stone\u2019s throw away and if you want to grab coffee and people watch in a beautiful shaded park, Parque Espa\u00f1a is  close by and gorgeous in the mornings. Overall, another great stay and I can\u2019t wait to be able to stay here again! Thank you Sandro & Ines!"

The place is extremely convenient, very central, walkable to the best spots, and located in a safe area. Their lovely home itself was perfect for two of us with all necessary appliances at hand. We spent our entire days running around so we did not get to enjoy the little balcony but the space was always comfortable to come back to rest for the night. Sandro and Ines were always extremely quick to respond and helped us with any questions we had for our trip (including tips for planning, advice for reservations, and some last minute requests we had) - they were both super friendly and kind with their time based on our conversations. We were lucky to have had such wonderful hosts that added to our amazing first experience we had in Mexico."
