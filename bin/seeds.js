I convinced a co-worker who is new to the country to try this tasting tour with me and we were both blown away. Paige is a wonderful host and has a wealth of knowledge about beer. You can definitely tell it's her passion! The tour is roughly 3 hours and covers 3 completely different breweries in a very walkable area. We were able to taste a flight of beer at each stop and even though I love beer, Paige let me switch it up and I tried a couple handcrafted sodas and a cider at Callister! Delicious! It was probably for my benefit as the amount of beer was much more than I anticipated. Overall a great experience especially for those who are serious beer lovers and are interested in learning more about the local scene. Highly recommend!! "

Not only were the breweries and beer great but Paige was super knowledgable and fun!  I thought I knew just about all there was to know about beer (especially Vancouver beer) but I still managed to learn a few new things this weekend.  Great value too, much more beer than I anticipated (hint: leave your cars at home ).  Highly recommend for all beer enthusiasts, this tour really shows some of the best the city has to offer!  "

When we arrived the other two couples had also been prepped about our delay and seemed to be as laid back as Paige...which helped with our anxiety about being late. The actual tour was wonderful. Paige was very knowledgeable in all of the breweries that we went to and even worked or is working at all three. She kept conversations going and was very good about not just talking to one person but walked around and discussed tastings and interests of which beer is (Website hidden by Airbnb) all. If you like beer even just a little, this is a great Experience to explore the wonderments of the beautiful city of Vancouver."

As a former employee of the breweries we toured, she has an insider's knowledge of each of their histories, approach, successes, even their business models! Our tour even included spending time in the back of house areas and a chance to chat with one of the brewmasters.\n\nPaige is working through the four levels of cicerone accreditation, so is serious about the science and flavour components of beer - and it shows. But more than that, she is a consummate booster of local small business and a budding entrepreneur in her own right. Her enthusiasm was contagious and our group ended the evening with hugs all around. Highly recommended experience to all. Be prepared to try all styles (and strengths) of beer. "

The neighborhood is  fantastic, great to go out, full of restaurant, green and bars. It is one of the best areas in Mexico City to walk around\n2. The house is nice and the breakfast is fine\n\nThe bad\n1. You see various pictures on the site but then you don't know what you will get. I don't know if we were unlucky but we got a tiny room (no picture of that were on the site) so you don't (necessarily) get what you see\n2. Our room had a problem, the toilet was not flushing so we asked to be changed and after some negotiations the person working there realized this was really a problem and changed us. \n3. We slept for one night in a nice room however when we came back in the evening our room was occupied by someone else. The people working at the house had taken all our stuff and moved it - I find it incredible, it was the first time, that someone would be doing this - we had left a lot things in the room and things had to be moved and obviously be put in a totally different order. \n4. We were told that in our old room the toilet problem had been fixed but it was not true. Even worse, the guy working there pretended I was being annoying and it had been fixed until when I obliged him to come and check by himself- the toilet was still not flushing (so we could not use it). He accepted it but could not do anything. \n5. We were offered the option to go sleeping elsewhere for that night but it was already 10.30pm - and we would have had to go back the day after. I declined and was promised the day after the toilet would have been fixed\n6. The day after the toilet was finally flushing but an awful smell would come out. It was late, we were exhausted so decided to still spend there the last night but not go back. \n\nI had explained to Fer0do I would leave this review and I was sorry for that, it is not nice to leave a bad review but I think it is fair for other people. In the end he was kind and did not charge me for the laundry (a couple of shirts and one pair of trousers). I found that a kind gesture but frankly not enough to cancel all that had gone wrong. \n\nOverall\nBased on my experience, I would suggest to guests to look for some other place in Condesa. \n\n"

Staying at Condesa Haus was definitely one of my favorite parts of the trip. My friend and I both agreed that the Porforio Room was the coolest room that either of us had ever stayed in. The roof top deck is perfect for lounging at the end of the day, or all day for that matter. Breakfast was informal and tasty and a great time to hit up Fer0do for recommendations. He'll draw you a map and make sure you know exactly what to do. By the end of the trip we had a collection of his maps. Ask him about the history and themes of each room. Ask him about the restaurant in the cave behind the pyramid. Ask him to take you out for mezcal;) The property is an old estate that he and his partner tastefully modernized. Such a great place. I highly recommend Condesa Haus. Can't wait to go back someday!"

The bathtub shown in the photos are not representative of what we got which is a standard household bathtub. Moreover, the room was in bad condition. The bathroom wall was decaying. We felt it should not be an appropriate room to host in. Especially not for the price we paid.\r\nWe felt a bit cheated.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the staff was kind and helpful. And the breakfast was good. The complex and neighborhood felt very safe."

This is unlike all our other airbnb experiences where the apartment was privately owned. As a result,there is housekeeping, reception staff and breakfast. By far the best part of our stay was the reception staff. Friendly, helpful, informative. In a casual way they are the ones that really made the stay a pleasant one. Our room, which was on the second floor and faced the back, was really basic. Small, creaky floors, dim lights, lumpy foam pillows, very little closet/storage. BUT.....clean, great WIFI and TV, decent washroom and shower, little or no street noise. \r\nI would say equivalent to a 3 star hotel. The location in Condesa could not be better. Steps to Starbucks, cafes and restaurants. The metrobus on Insurgentes is a 10 min walk. There are two Metro stops about a 10 min walk. Roma is a pleasant 20 min walk. Polanca and the museums were a bit far for us to walk, but are certainly possible. The taxis were always able to get us back to Condesa Haus without a problem as the location seems to be well known. We read about all the problems with taxis, but never had a bad experience except that metered rides from the same locations would vary quite a lot. We could be in a taxi for 20-30 minutes and get charged 150 pesos and be in one for 5 min and get charged 115 pesos. Other than that, we always felt safe and for the most part taxi drivers were friendly. \r\nTo sum up. Fer0do was easy to communicate with and because there was a reception desk, the hotel could be called at any time. The staff was really great and helped us throughout the week. They seemed genuinely happy to help us. The hotel itself, an old building that has been cleaned up and painted, was never an issue. Maybe the bed mattress, pillows and sheets could use an upgrade in future, but although not the best quality, all was clean and tidy. Location, fantastic. \r\nCondesa Haus was not our first choice and I think Fer0do has better properties as well, but because of the holiday season a lot of places were booked out. So I was not expecting a lot and in the end we had a very very pleasant stay. Although we might look elsewhere when we return to Mexico City, I would certainly not hesitate to return to Condesa Haus.\r\n"

The owner suggested that I stay in another of his B&Bs (Distrito Condesa) near by instead. I stayed there for two nights, On checkin (I arrived around 15:00) I had to wait about 20 minutes on the street for someone to come and open the door. the rooms are very old, very basic furniture, bathroom is very old, water leaking on the floor and into the room. Worst of all is the sound insulation, I could not sleep the second night because I could hear the guest in the next room clearing his throat! as if he was in the same room as me. The noise of someone going up and down some metal stairs connected to the outside of the property until 2am resonating into the room, the noise of some machine working on and off all night. All in all, terrible experience and would not recommend it to anyone."

Only downside was that our room and the building in general was really cold in early January, but once we figured out the heater in our room even this was fine. Would highly recommend staying here! "

Even though the staff was very nice,  the room seemed stark, mattress was very, very firm, the tub stopper didn't work, and the floors squeaked with every step.    These sound like minor annoyances but put together make one think that there might be better options for the price paid. "

They provided information to secure taxis, breakfast was on time and included fruit, granola, and egg dishes. The room was very clean, with lots of light, clean towels were provided everyday. Overall a very pleasant and relaxing experience. \r\n\r\nThe one complaint I would have would be about the building itself. Most of the older beautiful buildings in the Condesa area don't have insulation so you may hear EVERYTHING from each of the rooms and it echoes across the whole place. Not sure how this problem might be addressed, but just a heads up."

It is in an excellent, safe neighborhood with nearby restaurants worth exploring.  Staff was even very welcoming to my parents that actually were staying at a Hotel over in Polanco section of city the 2 times they came by to meet up with those of us staying at Condesa Haus.  Daily breakfast was very appreciated and gave our family a quiet time to chat before the each day's activities."

The claw tub was a great addition to the room, it also has beautiful light throughout the day and big windows - such a dreamy room, hard to leave! Bed was very comfortable and quiet to sleep at night. \nLocation is great for exploring the Condesa/Roma area. Staff were very friendly & helpful. \nUnfortunately breakfast was disappointing and needs improvement - I was never shown or offered a full menu during my stay and the orange juice was not fresh but from concentrate. \nLardo however is an easy walking distance and does an amazing breakfast/brunch - highly recommend. \nI also highly recommend staying at Condesa Haus while in CDMX, especially for longer stays for more of a homely vibe. \nThanks Fer0do! I will be back."

The premium\r\nbuilding would feel at home in San Francisco's SOMA district.\r\n\r\nHowever, I much preferred Nath's Roma Norte neighborhood, an up and coming\r\narea composed of small, leafy plazas with fountains and historic Spanish\r\nColonial Revival buildings interspersed with contemporary construction and\r\nsome small universities. The area is reputed to have one of the largest\r\nclusters of top restaurants in Mexico City. Cafes are also abundant. The\r\narea maintains a bit of an edge and is a reasonable walk to the happening\r\nCondessa area just to the south. The loft is also about ten minutes walk to\r\nMetro stations to the east or west.\r\n\r\nNath was a friendly and attentive host who went above and beyond any\r\nexpectation for accommodating me. She spent a good while inquiring as to my\r\ninterests and then came up with a half dozen suggestions that she wrote\r\ndown for me. She also was kind enough to drive me at Museum Row and open\r\nher network of contacts to me.\r\n\r\nNath's spacious loft is fresh and clean and sunny. It's decorated in a\r\nsmart, busy professional-meets-university professor (think overflowing\r\nstacks of books) style with mid-Century modern pieces added to the mix.\r\n\r\nThe loft's headliner is the bedroom with a decadent king size bed and\r\nsumptuous sheets and pillows, done up in a hotel suite manner with a couch,\r\nshag rug and flat screen TV. Disclaimer: I'm normally not a fan of lofts\r\nbecause I need darkness in order to sleep; not a problem at Nath's.\r\n\r\nAt under $150 a night, Nath's property is right-priced. A nice, trendy\r\nhotel two blocks away was asking $100 more for their starter, single\r\noccupancy room. Nath was responsive, flexible, and overall good to deal\r\nwith and her listing was accurately and honestly described. If anything,\r\nshe has undersold it."

Our stay at Naths in Roma- one of the coolest areas of Mexico City was all the better for staying here. Nath's apartment was extremely clean and we had everything we needed for our stay. The apartment itself is a quiet retreat from the busyness of the city and offers a beautiful terrace where you can enjoy the morning light. Nath's apartment was bright and airy and we would highly recommend to anyone! Nath was fantastic to communicate with and provided us with a fantastic list of local recommendations.

The apartment is airy and light and lovely, with a great terrace and an extremely comfy bed. If you like modernism more than cookie-cutter contemporary, you'll be very happy here. The neighborhood is great, with lots of places to eat from great street tacos to high end, and with the 24-hour doorman extremely secure. The metro is walkable, but uber and cabify are so tempting and easy to use in Mexico City.  Look forward to returning."

Nath is creative and it shows in her decoration, her fittings, her art and her books. The space is bright and airy and unfussed while still retaining tonnes of character and charm. The building has a 24h doorman and the neighborhood is safe and practical. The terrace is gorgeous and the bedroom upstairs is spacious yet cosy.\r\n\r\nTo call Roma Norte (the neighborhood) the best place in MC would be an understatement, you are very literally surrounded by the prettiest streets, the best restaurants and bars and wonderful shops. \r\n\r\nHighly recommended!"

The location is great, it feels like Roma and is walkable to both the boutique area of Roma/Condesa but conveniently close to Juarez for the mall, banks, markets and subway station. But my favorite aspect of Nathalia's apartment is the modern and open living space with the huge stone terrace. I highly recommend picking up some pastries and coffee from Panader\u00eda Rosetta Roma and enjoying the morning sun on the terrace. Bedroom was nice with good blinds for sleeping in and a comfy bed. Nath also left some fresh fruit and a jug of water upon arrival and was very responsive to all my messages. "

There is 24 hour security provided by the most charming guards you are likely to meet. Nathalia is kind and responsive. The whole affair is highly recommendable."

The apartment is beautifully decorated, had everything we needed, has a beautiful terrace, has a 24/7 security/door person and has one of the most comfortable beds I have slept in. It is located in Roma. You can't take 10 steps without walking by great restaurants, bars, galleries, and cafes. Nath makes check in and out super easy and is very responsive. I would definitely stay here again!"

The kitchen, bathrooms and laundry were perfect. The bed was so comfortable. Plenty of wardrobe space for my clothes. I could not have found a more perfect place. The location was amazing, close to wonderful cafes and restaurants, some boutique clothing stores, metro, taco stands, banks, ecobici and fantastic coffee!\r\nNathalia was an amazing host, the best I've had. Very easy to contact and quick to help if I had any questions or concerns. Very caring and concerned for me to have the best stay :)\r\nI stayed her for almost 2 months because I enjoyed it so much.\r\nI will be back as soon as I can, I loved this place :)"

Good security in a complex with a nice mixture of modern and old architecture.\r\n\r\nThe photos represent exactly the apartment.\r\n\r\nThings to improve: water pressure is good but inconstant.

The location is excellent- a charming neighborhood with many nice places to eat and shop. The building has a twenty four hour doorman, which made us feel very secure at all hours.\n\nThe apartment is very charming, with lovely art and books everywhere. A well appointed kitchen would making cooking very easy, if that was desired. There are two bathrooms, and we always had hot water when we needed it. \n\nThe balcony is very nice to sit outside and enjoy the morning sunshine. I really enjoyed my stay at Nath's and would return in a heartbeat."

The apartment was as described from the photos: full of light and plants and books, a great location in Roma, and security at the entrance to boot. The neighborhood was a bit sleepy on Dec 31 and Jan 1, which we were surprised by (coming from NYC!) but that's to be expected. It was aboht a 30-45 min walk to the center, which we did almost every day, and were able to get a great feel for the neighborhoods if Mexico City we walked through. We loved walking around toward Condesa, through all the gorgeous plazas. Importantly the apt has a big percolator for morning coffees, a grocery store around the corner (for bottled water and quick breakfast supplies). Also a few blocks from an excellent bakery. Nath left us great suggestions and was an easy and communicative host. Highly recommend!! "

It wasn't an issue for us, but worth keeping in mind."

Although I did not have the opportunity to personally meet Nicholas (he was away on vacation himself), throughout the reservation process he was very helpful, and he answered my questions very promptly.  He arranged for a friend to be there upon my arrival to give me the keys and to help me get settled in.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is very pleasant, spacious, comfortable and homey.  His ecletic collection of artwork adds a lot of personality to the place.  The cleaning lady comes in once a week and gives everything a thorough cleaning.  Nicholas had a more than adequate supply of jugs of purified water on hand.  No need to go out and buy bottled water.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is very interesting with a lot of wonderful architecture and an \"trendy\", upper middle class atmosphere.  I felt safe walking around even late at night.  There are a lot of restaurants in the area. It would take you months to try them all.  Everything you need... supermarket, pharmacy, ATM, laundry, etc... is within walking distance, and the bus stop and subway station are close so that you can easily get to other parts of the city.\r\n\r\nI loved having my own refuge amid the hustle and bustle of Mexico City, and I definitely hope to return!\r\n"

There are lots of cafes, mezcalerias, bars and restaurants and two beautiful parks within a few blocks, and we felt safe walking around at all hours of the night. We would definitely stay there again, and we would definitely recommend it to any one looking to travel to Mexico City. "

Not only is it incredibly charming and cute, Nicholas provides a ton of maps and is incredibly responsive when making a reservation (and incredibly patient when i accidentally cancelled the reservation and needed to re-book). While I didn't get a chance to meet Nicholas, his friend Veronica was very patient and kind when our flights were originally cancelled and then delayed. \r\n\r\nCondesa is a fabulous area - truly beautiful and great restaurants, cafes, and convenience stores to choose from and an easy walk to a lot of the sites and the metro. \r\n\r\nThe only issues I had (as a female) was that there was no full length mirror (easy remedy with a camera phone) and it was a bit cold (as we were there in the rainy season) and we couldn't tell whether or not there was heat and where to find it so we just bundled up with extra blankets.

They are both artists and have written books about Mexico City; a copy is available at the apartment.\r\nThe apartment has all normal facilities (including a full bath), it is nicely decorated (see the pictures on the website) and has many pictures, books about art and cooking and finally a collection of CD's to listen to. In short, a home-away-from-home. \r\nThe Condesa area where the apartment is located is a truly enjoyable area, with many shops, cafes and restaurants. As Europeans we enjoyed walking around this historic Art Deco area. To us it also seemed very safe as it is an area where people live. The Parque Mexico is just around the corner. The Condesa area is also central for sightseeing with most sights a short and cheap taxi ride away or with public transportation (which we did not use). \r\nThe apartment is highly recommended (Website hidden by Airbnb)"

We were received by Nicholas's partner who patiently awaited our (delayed) arrival, on a Friday night no less, and then took the time to chat and give us some great recommendations about where to go that night. It's no wonder that he authored a guide book on Mexico City and that Nicholas has written a guide on Mexican cuisine in the city (with an award winning blog to match). Both books are conveniently available for your use, and we were quite thankful to have them.  Nicholas and his partner are also artists, which can be appreciated in the eclectic decor with rich textiles, antiques and pieces collected from around the world. You can imagine that each item has a unique story and, juxtaposed against the original art deco moldings and features of this historic apartment, it made for a beautiful atmosphere to relax in before and after our daily sightseeing journeys. It's also a great base to do your exploring from: conveniently located in one of our favorite barrios, la Condesa, it has an abundance of gorgeous art deco buildings, nightlife, restaurants, galleries and greenery. And it\u2019s only a short walk to its slightly more hipster neighbor, Roma, another great barrio to explore. It felt extremely safe walking around la Condesa, even at night, and it wasn't uncommon to bump into dog walkers or joggers running on their tree-lined avenue, once a hippodrome, at any hour. The subway was also easily accessible from their apartment, which we relied on heavily during our stay in addition to taxis (Nicholas provided the number of a reliable company). I see in one of the reviews that there was critique about it being a bit cold. We came in March and it was a bit chilly in the city at night (almost a 20 degree drop from the day), but that was also easily fixed by the abundant extra blankets around the apartment and having brought our warm Canadian clothing. Anyhow, that's just a matter of preparing for the weather before you come.  Other details were a fully equipped kitchen with a small balcony overlooking the inner courtyard, nice hot showers, filtered water, a big screen tv in the bedroom with a dvd player in case you want a night in, and a good wifi connection. All in all, we wouldn't hesitate to come back to this apartment on our next trip to Mexico City - and we are definitely planning on returning to the D.F. one day to finish our exploring. A great place to stay in a great city. Thanks Nicholas and Jim!"

It is in a great location - steps away from the lovely Matisse restaurant, Parque Mexico, groceries and other cafes nearby including a Starbucks.  It is also a minute walk to the main Insurgentes where you can catch taxis or bus transportation.   \r\n\r\nThe apartment is beautifully decorated, the internet and phone connections were good too.  We did not have a chance to meet our host but the keys were conveniently left near a store at the ground floor and we had no problems getting in touch with Nicholas if we had questions.

I found the location noisy as the bedroom is right on the street, but it was a weekend and lots of party goers outside and police sirens.   Sitting area is light and airy but no view and as someone who likes to throw open windows and have outside living, I felt it rather claustrophobic in general.  The living spaces were clean.   The bedroom needed to have the windows thrown open and a blast of air through as the atmosphere in there was rather stale.   The pillows could do with an upgrade too!   I requested a floor standing heater but it was unavailable on arrival so kindly Nick supplied an extra blanket for the bed which looked a little grubby.  All in all it is an attractive apartment in an excellent location."

I was really surprised by Condesa. I knew it was convenient and had lots of restaurants. I didn't expect it to be so pretty, leafy and quiet. A true refuge in a crazy city. The bedroom in the apartment was on the second floor facing the street yet it was still very quiet (except for Friday night until about 11). Everything we needed was close by: supermercado, farmacia, sitio, turibus stops, etc. We also loved being so close to the lovely park. This was my favorite airbnb experience ever (and all but one have been very good). "

Nick was a great host - trusting, helpful, and accommodating to our needs. The apartment has a lot of information about the neighborhood and where to eat, which is highly useful even for people like us that have been visiting/living in DF for many years.\r\n\r\nThe only minor issue was that the bed in the second bedroom is a little hard, but we would definitely recommend staying here and will stay here again if we can!"

Apartment ended up being perfectly located near loads of restaurants and parks, and Ubers everywhere were cheap. A little bit of light/noise pollution in the bedroom at night (didn't bother me at all but bothered my friend a bit). Felt pretty safe at night!

If you like to cook, or just bring back food to the apartment, this is the place for you:  well-stocked kitchen is an understatement.  And, of course, the location:  you're in the hip Condesa with great restaurants and places to walk in the evening;  and, at the same time you're just across the Insurgentes from Roma Sur where you'll find even better (and cheaper) food in the fondas, puestos, and Mercado Medellin.   If you're lucky enough to be here on a Tuesday, don't miss the Condesa tianguis, the great weekly market about 10 minutes walk away.  Or, walk north into Roma Norte for more great restaurants and entirely different feel with its Porfiriano architecture.  In the past, we've used taxis and the metro, but Uber now makes it even easier to get around:  depending on traffic, you are 20 minutes from the Centro and even closer to the museums in Chapultepec.  Nick is a great host:  easy to reach and always a source for good eats in Mexico City and elsewhere in Mexico."

Trisha's an excellent host and the folks who work with her are great. I'd recommend bringing ear plugs for sleeping, since the downstairs studio (where we stayed) is near the street, which has a lot of action. We'd definitely stay there again (with earplugs)! It's a perfect little studio -- lovely design, nice little kitchen (with all the dishes, etc. one could need), comfy couch and a great desk/workspace. "

A couple of blocks from the apartment is a big supermarket and walking to the center of Coyacan is easily done by foot in ten minutes. The studio is sparsely decorated but has everything you need. The floor is amazing and so is the Acapulco chairs, I wish I could take the whole studio back to San Francisco and place it here! Mexico City was an amazingly good experience and I'll be back for sure! Wouldn't hesitate where to stay!"

Loved waking to the sound of the birds and going out for an invigorating jog at Viveros Coyoacan just minutes away. If you go up to the terrace on the roof you can see Frida Kahlo's blue house, which practically next door. Trisha also provided tips on the area, dvd's, and a well stocked collection of take out menus from nearby restaurants. The washer and dryer downstairs was also a plus since I travel light.\r\n\r\nI would definitely stay there again next time I go back to Coyoacan!\r\n\r\nThank you Trisha."

The location is also amazing, located literally on the same block as Frida Khalos's \"Casa Azul\", and also just minutes away from the incredible \"Mercado Coyoacan\" where you can find delicious food and produce for ridiculously low prices.

My partner and I are both artists and this was a perfect location for those interested in the history of Frida Kahlo and the neighborhood she called home. \r\n\r\nThe staff were very helpful and friendly. The space was full of light and charming. The best part was the small patio in the back and access to the roof space where I spent my mornings sketching and planning out the day's activities. \r\n\r\nIn terms of its location and access to other parts of the city, I wouldn't say it was super convenient. The closest Metro stop is realistically 20 minutes away, and once you reach the metro it can take some time to get to certain parts of the city like the Zocalo and Chapultepec. However, we did not have any trouble navigating and exploring the city using the recommended secure taxi and other safe transportation apps (Uber just launched in the city), which were very reasonably priced. The neighborhood was quiet and safe at night. We spent several evenings walking to the plaza where we enjoyed great cuisine and a lively atmosphere.  \r\n\r\nI would definitely consider staying here again on a future trip. "

Trish is an interesting, creative person and a great host, very obliging and ready to provide information. It was great knowing she was there across the patio. The apartment feels spacious and fresh, is very light and airy, is beautifully and simply decorated, and has everything you could need. There is a rooftop terrace virtually overlooking Frida Kahlo's house/ museum, which is directly behind the apartment. I spent a few days just hanging out in Coyoacan as it is a beautiful, interesting and creative neighbourhood with a great atmosphere, a number of museums (Frida, Trotsky museums both extremely close to the apartment) and other points of interest, beautiful squares and parks, some interesting shops and galleries, lots of great food - restaurants, cafes, bars - and a wonderful market. I was on my own but felt quite safe walking around the local area even in the evening. It was quite easy to walk to access the metro station/s to get to Centro and other parts of Mexico City. It's a bit of a walk to the station but I didn't mind that at all, especially as it's such a great place to walk around (in fact I walked on different days to each of the three different metro stations in the area) - it's also possible to hop on a local bus to get to the metro. \r\n\r\nAs an alternative to staying right in central Mexico City, and especially if you're inspired by Frida and/or Diego and want a taste of bohemian Mexico but still with the convenience of easy access to everything else that Mexico City has to offer, this is an amazing place to stay.

The biggest plus is that it's literally right around the corner from La Casa Azul. Trisha went out of her way to assure our brief stay was enjoyed to the max. She not only informed us of a handful of her local favorites, but connected us with her personal driver for a day trip outside of the city, prior to arrival. My only regret is not being able to stay longer than 48 hours!"

Trisha kindly agreed to us dropping our luggage at the apartment before check-in time, which was really helpful to us. \r\nThe apartment is decorated in a simple stylish manner - the use of colour is just beautiful - exactly as shown in the photos. The only thing we didn\u2019t realize from the photos was that the apartment is on the second floor, accessed by an external spiral staircase (not a problem for us, but may be something to consider if you have big luggage or mobility problems). We found the apartment was clean & quiet; the bed was very comfortable & the water pressure in the shower was great. Loved the way the bathroom was decorated! We didn\u2019t really cook, but it was very handy to have the kitchen facilities available to prepare food. The terraces outside were an added bonus - hummingbirds visited the potted citrus trees that were in flower. \r\nCoyoac\u00e1n is a lovely historical peaceful area of Mexico City & the locals were amazingly friendly & helpful to us as we bumbled around not speaking any Spanish!  The apartment is around the corner from Frida Khalo\u2019s Casa Azul & is only a couple of blocks from the market & main squares at the centre of Coyoac\u00e1n & the Museo Nacional de las Culturas Populares. We found there were plenty of taxis to take us to the centre of Mexico City & the airport.\r\nWe loved staying here & would recommend the apartment for its comfort, peacefulness & convenience, & will definitely check out its availability when we return to Mexico City.\r\n"

There is a steep curving staircase leading up to the unit, and as I have recently taken a bad fall and must use a cane, Trisha insisted that I enter through her own home and office, to make it easier for me! She left the doors unlocked so I could come and go safely. Lovely people, lovely location - you could wander for days through Coyoacan and still not see it all. Best was the Day of the Dead celebrations in a nearby plaza. Mucho gracias, Isobel too, for making my stay so comfortable and enjoyable!"

We will keep in touch and we hope to see you in Toronto during TIFF.\nBesitos to Juli, Isabel and Teo!\n\n- The Ryans and Lorenzo"

She offered to arrange a driver for us when we mentioned wanting to go to the pyramids- and we are really glad we took her up on it. She even let us borrow a movie one night when it was pouring rain and we couldn't go out.

The location was around the corner from Frida Kahlo's house. The apartment had a ton of natural light, a fully equipped kitchen and captured the essence of Mexican decor and charm. It was within walking distance to all our wedding festivities and the lovely zocalos, markets and cafes. Trisha made sure we were comfortable and gave us many recommendations for coffee, food, and shopping. "

It's this amazing compound-type house with access to the roof overlooking a beautiful tree lined street. There are flowers everywhere and the neighborhood is generally very quiet. I forgot that it's really not too far from the highway. There are multiple spiral staircases, and the apartment is drenched in sunlight at all times. \r\nTrisha was an excellent host, keeping in touch with us but not being at all overbearing. She called us an uber to the airport when we left which was unexpected and extremely kind. Our *only* complaint was that the cleaning fee doubles the price of the room, which seems a bit misleading. Still, the place was nearly spotless (I think that was Teo's doing - we didn't interact much but she was also very kind!) and we felt very comfortable there. The flowers and the sweets on the table were such a nice touch. We'd love to stay with Trisha again - we didn't want to leave DF! "

The place is stunning - Trisha has put her original creative touch on a beautiful Coyoacan studio, and the roof terrace is truly marvellous. It was a real delight to arrive at 6.30 in the morning and hear the concert of birdsong and watch the rising sun above the jacaranda trees from the terrace - from which, by the way, you get a view down onto Frida Kahlo's garden! Trisha was away most of the time we were there, but Teo (the wonderful Mexican lady who works there) looked after us brilliantly. She let us use the phone to make a couple of calls, gave us advice on taxis, etc.  Thanks for everything, Trisha, I can't wait to be back!"

She's also simply a very cool and caring person, and I wish we would have spent more time talking.\n\nThe home is beautiful and feels very secure. It's right around the corner from Museo Frida Kahlo and just a few minutes walk to many other things. Getting an Uber is super quick and inexpensive if you need to visit other neighborhoods, which we did daily. \n\nWe would stay here again in a heartbeat and thoroughly recommend booking with Trisha if you're looking to stay in Coyoac\u00e1n."

El departamento no es realmente independiente de la casa principal. El acceso es a trav\u00e9s de una escalera de caracol, lo que hace dif\u00edcil el traslado del equipaje y el desplazamiento de personas mayores o con dificultades motoras. En nuestro caso, parte de los utensilios de cocina no estaban limpios y hubo una fiesta ruidosa en la casa principal una, de las noches de nuestra estancia."

Subway only 5$ each journey and easy to use.  \n The apartment is  comfortable and has a very well equipt kitchen, little terrace area, within a complex of other apartments and a office area next door, spiral staircases to each level.\n The water worked well and plenty of hot water, sprays from the shower onto the floor otherwise wonderful.  Use of washing machine and a place to hangout to dry.\nWiFi worked OK, the router was in the office near by. Trisha was friendly and helped with any problems and suggestions of places to go.\nWe had no problems and enjoyed our stay here, lovely flowers and extra thoughtful things in the apartment.  The only problem was the floor, it was hard to keep clean.   We were able to park on the street and had no problem with a parking space outside the house.   \nFrida Kahlo Museum just around the corner."

I emailed Trisha to let her know because she had made special arrangements to be available personally when I arrived.  Because of the late cancellation, I certainly did not expect any refund.  Trisha responded immediately, first suggesting I reconsider as she thought Coyoacan in March was the perfect place to heal a broken heart.  After mulling it over, I decided not to go and emailed her.  To my surprise (and without me asking), Trisha refunded $100 and added she would find ways to make up the rest of what I lost should I come down in the future.  This level of concern for me as an individual certainly tops any AirBnB experience I've every had, and I have never had a bad experience.  Thanks, Trisha!"

Trisha is the best and will help you with very easy check-in and out, as well as offer great travel trips. The apartment is very cozy for two people, complete with an awesome outdoor space.

Trisha is a smart, sharp, and very helpful and thoughtful lady.  She welcomed us into her home (during our honeymoon) with fresh flowers, a bottle of wine and a sweet note to congratulate us! She even hand drew us a really good map of where to go/who to ask for/etc in like 5 seconds. (I will be framing it)  \n\nYou will be steps away from everything you need, tons of things to do, and Coyocan is beautiful!  It is a bright space for sure. With all the windows you will be smelling the flowers, waking with the sun, and feelin' the breeze all from the comfort of \"your own apartment\" .\n\nFor picky ppl: bed=firm, and the main access route is a small metal spiral staircase you will have to get used to (not a big deal at all, just don't pack 5 LV trucks full of clothes).  Thanks again, Trisha!"

Everything you need you will find in the studio - french press for coffee, smooth linens, a desk, a table and your own little cafe table and private patio. Trisha is a gracious host who is there when needed, leaving the independent traveller alone, helping those who require more help.

As I result I had to leave a place that truly felt like my first home in Mexico City and I could have stayed here forever! Firstly, Trisha's responsiveness to messages and willingness to help me sort out the details of traveling to a new place are what every solo travel wishes for in an Airbnb host. And on my first night there, she graciously went for a walk with me to show me the \"lay of the land\" in Coyoacan. Speaking of Coyoacan, it is a hidden treasure of culture, beautiful spaces and a VERY authentic CDMX. Having spent time in the hot spots of this city (aka. la Roma and la Condesa, and Polanco) I found Trisha's neighborhood to be a perfect \"Bienvenidos\" to a city so large and at times even overwhelming; and a charming oasis to return to after touring around. If you're hesitant about being too far from the action, don't be. While it is true, it's about a 30-minute drive to some of the above mentioned hot spots, keep in mind that an Uber to anywhere of note is about 100 pesos (or $4 or $5 US) ANY time of day or night. In exchange, you will love waking up to the quiet tranquility of a neighborhood that feels like a small town within a big city. There are endless cultural centers within walking distance - like Casa de Cultura Jes\u00fas Reyes Heroles, and book stores (check out Centro Cultural Elena Garro); a Buddhist center...a beautiful yoga studio with some amazing teachers, not even 100 yards away from the (Website hidden by Airbnb) excellent bakery with delicious coffee - Pan Verde, one of the best movie theaters I have ever been too - Cineteca Nacional; and in addition to traditional markets, a lovely organic grocery store and cafe an easy 15-20 minute walk away through Coyoacan's main plaza and past charming homes and through beautiful, sometimes cobble stoned streets. Oh! And it's home to one of CDMX's best chains El Jarocho...a true Mexico City establishment that you can find on almost every corner of Coyoacan, but apparently no where else in other parts of the city. I will miss it all, but will be back again soon! I haven't even talked about the apartment itself - super clean, great linens and bedding, so well equipped, comfy bed, reliable Wi-fi, airy and bright...yada yada yada... All the usual things people say about a great Airbnb, except this one is better :)"

Even though the geographical center of the new-born State of CDMX is the Coyoacan borough, Mexico City spreads beyond its state's borders to the north and to the east, with the geographical center being displaced to the north. The Miguel Hidalgo borough, to the which Colonia Escand\u00f3n pertains, conforms, together with Cuauhtemoc and Venustiano Carranza, the actual geographical center of the metropolitan area; which translates into more transportation services at hand, plus faster and easier transfers to and from any place in the city. Our area offers you have a wide array of transportation choices that allows you to move around and take a glimpse of the city. There are 2 subway stations (Tacubaya & Patriotismo), 2 metrobus stations (Antonio Maceo & De La Salle), the #172 Eco-bici station (bike rentals), and the E-conduce Ciencias station (scooter rentals).

One has a king size bed, another has 2 queens, and the third has 2 doubles. It's secure, also, you need 4 keys to get through the 3 gate/doors before the actual door. The neighborhood is mostly very quiet and the neighbors are friendly. There's a kitchen, dishwasher, and clothes washer/dryer.\r\n\r\nIt's on a back street in the Escandon neighborhood, so most taxi drivers need to be shown the location on a map or have it explained. You are also a 5 minute walk from either the Tacubaya or Patriotismo metro (subway) stops. There is a grocery store nearby, also.\r\n\r\nIt's a good place to share with friends, if you're willing to be a little bit away from the fancier Condesa and Polanco neighborhoods."

The kitchen was wonderfully stocked with kitchen utensils and the fridge was large enough to accommodate a lot of groceries.

The place was maybe slightly outdated (furnishings) but very spacious and clean. Gabriela was there when we arrived and provided a warm welcome. The location of the apartment was excellent for us since we had to go to the World Trade Center for work and would go to La Condesa for the evening. I can only recommend the place, not only for private trips but also for business people."

It's spacious rooms and generous and well appointed bedrooms made us feel like we we're staying in a high end hotel (or with rich relatives!). The neighborhood itself is very quiet and well maintained (as is the entire complex that this house is part of). It was equally nice to have the convenience of a large grocery store only a couple of blocks away--and the police station nearby made us feel safe, although Colonia Escandon is a very safe neighborhood. It's really great that it is such a close walk to Colonia Condesa too (literally next door), with all the hip bars, restaurants, and shops. And equally convenient is the Metro stop--located on the rear of the big grocery store--which, for 35 cents a ride--will hook you up to all the great spots in this great city. Most of all, we felt so welcomed and looked after by Gabriela, Jorge and Mona's sister-in-law and de facto GM of the property. I can't even begin to express of gratitude for all the advice and help that she gave. She is friendly, warm, and has a real interest in making sure that you have what you need. OUR FIRST, BUT DEFINITELY NOT OUR LAST TIME TO THIS EXCITING CITY. MEXICO LINDO!"

What is important is that management respond quickly and agreeably and Gabby did exactly that. \r\n\r\nHouse is three blocks from Soriana grocery, four from Tacubaya Metro station, four from sitio stand  and about 10 from restaurant heavy areas of Condessa.

The home felt very spacious for our group of seven people.  It is located in a very nice part of the city and offers convenient access to all parts of the city.  The bedrooms are large, the beds are comfortable, and the four bathrooms made it easy for us to all get ready morning and night without any hassle.  Everything is very clean.  The house is very secure with a double gated courtyard, and the neighbors in the complex are friendly and quiet.  The neighborhood is very safe.\r\n\r\nGabriela, our hostess, maintained an open line of communication with us before our stay to ensure a smooth arrival.  She was there to greet us, and kindly checked in with us during our stay and made sure that everything about our stay exceeded expectations.  We could not have been more pleased with her consideration and the home.  \r\n\r\nThank you Jorge, Monnah, and Gabriela.  We heartily recommend this home to anyone traveling to Mexico City (except when we want to stay there again).  And thank you airbnb for making this possible."

Gaby, the property manager, was very helpful when we arrived - she gave us directions to the nearest grocery store, metro stops and nearby restaurants. Rooms were extremely comfortable and had more than enough space for us to get ready without being in each other's way.\r\n\r\nWe found a fantastic empanada just around the corner and a market at Alvarado on Tuesdays. Just a few blocks away, at the corner of Murgu\u00eda and Marti, were the best tacos we had during our visit - that in itself was worth the stay! A short walk away was the fun Condesa neighborhood and Uber covered us for everything else. We had a great time and will be coming back!"

The place is very clean, well equipped, and the neighborhood is quiet and friendly. If you walk 10-15 minutes, you will be in zone (condesa) with plenty of restaurants and bars. Two big and modern TVs with cable and wifi.  The living room is excellent for sharing moments with friends or family. Three big and spacious bedrooms, each one with complete bathroom. My friends and I are really happy with this experience. No doubt we are looking forward to rent  this place again in our next trip to Ciudad de M\u00e9xico. "

She made herself available at any time and even showed up at 4AM when we were leaving. She was always a text or a phone call away. Very easy going and very friendly. \r\n\r\nThe house is bigger than I thought and the rooms are very spacious. Uber was always less than 5 minutes away, basically the house is an central location with everything you need within a short distance. My family and I loved it and will stay there again."

We were traveling with a group of friends and not sure where we'd find space for so many, but this beautiful two story, 6-bedroom palace turned out to be perfect. We'd originally been looking in la Condesa, but though only a stone's throw away from all the restaurants and nightlife, we were much happier to be on this lovely tree-lined street in quiet Escandon, just to the south. Within blocks, we had several good metro options (minutes from downtown, or most other places we needed to reach), great taco stands, excellent coffee (Illusionista), delicious fresh pastries, and an absurdly adorable ice cream parlor (Helader\u00eda Escand\u00f3n), and a variety of corner groceries -- all tucked away in the trees and interesting mix of residential architecture. The house itself was unusually well-outfitted -- filtered water deliveries, a bathroom for every bedroom, two courtyards, roof, great common spaces to hang out in after a day out exploring the city, well-stocked kitchen, even one amazing bedroom in a library. Thanks, we couldn't have been happier."

The area is quiet, so you don't have to worry about loud noises. That said, you will most likely use Uber to travel anywhere from this location. It is in a residential area. Uber is fairly cheap, so I don't think that you will mind. The security of the home is great - multiple locked doors to go through in order to gain access. My group and I felt very safe here.\n\nI found the hosts to be very responsive and they provided plenty of advice our group. The bedrooms, bathrooms (of which there are plenty), and kitchen were all very clean and well-maintained. The common areas were the same. I'd highly recommend this home for your stay in Mexico City. While the location is not in a high-traffic part of town, every other aspect of the home is great."

The house is amazing with lots of lighting and everything you need in the kitchen if you decide to cook. 11 people stayed at this house and everyone had room for anything and what's even better is the amount of bathrooms which equal the amount of rooms in the house. Also Gabriela helped us with our food delivery order because we were having a hard time, so that was something we really appreciated. I can definitely recommend this house to anybody who wants to stay in Mexico city. "

From there I will discuss the good because credit should be given where it is deserved, and conclude with minor inconveniences. On the second day of our trip, my group and I returned to Monnah's house after spending the first half of the day at Chapultepec. Upon returning to the house, my group and I came to find the inner door of the home halfway open. My group consisted of six (6) people and we all saw the door. This was very strange so one person said, \"Hello? Is someone here?\" Immediately we all heard the kitchen door slam. I do not want to provide a layout of Monnah's home as I think that would present a safety issue, but suffice it to say, the door which slammed leads to an exit. I instructed everyone to leave the house in an attempt to preserve everyone's safety. My group and I have traveled to many Central American countries, and even Uganda, so the notion that someone would break into one's home to either steal valuables, or to collect information to later kidnap someone is not far-fetched at all. Let's be honest, kidnapping in Mexico City is not unheard of and therefore, we took this seeming intrusion very seriously. Standing in front of the home, we asked one another if anyone left the door open. I unequivocally stated \"no\" because I made a joke at one of my friends for initially exiting the home without closing the door behind her. As a result, I had to pull and lock the door prior to our departure. I called the property manager who told me she would send over the mainte0ce tech. It took the mainte0ce tech about 10 minutes to arrive, and in the meantime, the neighbors came out to ask what was going on. They were not convinced that someone could have gotten into the home because according to them it's very difficult to enter the home from where we suspect the alleged intruder had entered. Again, because this is a public review, I do not want to provide details of Monnah's house layout so I will not go in-depth about how we believe the intruder entered. When the mainte0ce tech arrived, he and two of my friends searched Monnah's home from top to bottom. I remained with the girls outside. In no time flat, both of my friends appeared from the entry point where we suspect someone may have broken into the home, and they confirmed that it would be relatively easy to access the same entry point. The mainte0ce tech also confirmed that two doors which lead to the exit point were unlocked. My friend then found his girlfriend's suitcase wide open, despite it being left closed prior to our departure that morning...."

She was always available 24 hours a day with any comments, questions, or concerns. Anyone who stays here will have no issues. There is not a doubt in my mind that Gaby can't fix anything. She was able to fix a plumbing issue right away. I want to advice any foreigner visiting Mexico. At my house in the USA I live in a gated community and I would still lock all my doors even my bedroom door when I leave my property. Use common sense people. Don't be frightened by the media."

Her responses were prompt, professional, and exceedingly helpful. After one member of our group had their luggage delayed, she offered to have it delivered to her so we didn't have to stick around the condo to wait for it. She was an indispensable part of our experience here.\n\nThe condo itself is very stylish but also functional. The second floor is accessible only by a flight of stairs. There is a closet full of various toiletry items at the top of the second floor which was also helpful. Beds were comfortable and towels were fluffy.\n\nEntry into the house was via a series of locked doors, each with their own key. This got a bit confusing at times but we appreciated the added security measures.\n\nOverall, would definitely recommend this spot for a stay for a large group in CDMX!"

There were six bedrooms, each with their own bathrooms so there was plenty of space and privacy. Each person had two towels and there was plenty of toilet paper. Gabriella was kind enough to let us check in early and check out late which was extremely helpful with our flight schedule. She also helped with local event recommendations and even called a place on our behalf to see if it was open. We really enjoyed this place and will return if we have another large group again."

Definitely on the nicer end. The hosts were available with quick responses whenever necessary, flexible with check-in and check-out and understanding and easy to work with when we had a minor accident. Overall a pleasant experience and we would repeat, thank you Monnah and Gaby!"

The house is beautiful, and on a very quiet street in a safe neighborhood close to three metro stops, and walking distance from Chapultepec park and Condesa.  We had the comforts of a tasteful home, at the same time as we had lots of  privacy.  Their dog Maya is adorable too.  Breakfast was prepared for us in the mornings, and their housekeeper was also kind enough to wash our laundry.  I would stay here again."

And the house is really lovely, better even than the photos, with a nice little garden that gets sun a few hours a day, very welcome here in this damp chilly city. The room is not huge but it is cozy and quiet and fresh and white, and feels like home, safe and secure. There is lots of storage space and a good firm mattress - Yes! There is also a  wonderful Saint Bernard if you love dogs. I hate to leave! one caveat: Paco does smoke, when he is there; I never said anything but he would probably accomodate, The bedroom is smoke free, though. And the house is well aired and cleaned every day by the adorable maid, Yolanda. So I can definitely recommend this rental!"

I can't say enough great things. Paco was there to welcome me when I arrived and had taken the trouble of printing out maps and directions for nearby attractions. He also introduced me to a friend of his who became my un-official tour guide and is now a good friend. When I had trouble finding somewhere to exchange currency, Paco was able to help out with that too. My first time in Mexico City was an incredible experience and Paco and his wife had everything to do with that. I'm extremely grateful to them. Also, the house is beautiful, clean and very comfortable. I could go on and on but you get the point! :)"

We enjoyed access to wireless that was fast and reliable. Our stay in Mexico City was enhanced by staying in a neighborhood that was close to all the important things we wanted to see: museums and Chapultepec Park. Paco's advise was always welcome - he knows everything about the City and what to do and when. Why stay anywhere else?"

They also have a delightful dog and my room and breakfast were excellent too. I'm running out of superlatives! The only negative thing for me was it was too short! Que lastima!! But the best things in life always leave you wanting more  :) so I would love to return to their fab home ASAP and to explore more of DF which I only scratched the surface of on my brief trip - I hope they come and visit me in LA so I can return their hospitality.

Paco and Maria Jose are exceptional hosts and really represent the best that airbnb can be.  The house is as depicted in the photographs: beautiful, stylish and clean.  The hospitality offered goes above and beyond, and the location is perfect for exploring the hipper parts of Mexico DF, like Colonia Condesa, which is very close and Colonia Roma which is a bit farther but still walkable.  The lovely park of Chapultepec is very nearby with museums and Polanco is also close.  We loved staying here!"

After spending 2 other trips in a hotel by the Zocolo with the hustle and bustle of the area their place was  the change we were looking for.  The photos on this site don't even come close to how beautiful a house Paco renovated with his own two hands.  I'm still surprised he could fit in such great workmanship in his off hours of being a doctor.  Although we are seasoned travellers we forgot to print a (Hidden by Airbnb) map of the area so got a bit lost finding the address.  We were pleasantly surprised to find Paco and his lovely Maya walking down the street to look for us.  He was worried we were lsot.  That showed us his true spirit of kindness.  His help in printing out area maps, giving us advice about the different areas to explore in DF and then along the southern coast were appreciated more than he will ever know.  Yolanda was so wonderful to us preparing a fantastic breakfast each morning and a cool drink in the afternoon when we showed up unexpectedly on our return journey home.  We have never met such generous people in our travels, even letting us sleep on the couch when the 2 rooms were fully booked.  We hope more will take it upon themselves to meet and stay with Paco, Marie Jose and Maya on their travels.  They are truly jewels and we look forward to staying with them again.  Please look at all of Paco's art work and photography, he is one very talented man.  Susan and Jan. Dec (Phone number hidden by Airbnb)"

The home is gorgeous and the guest room we stayed in was perfect. We were provided with a lot of great information on the surrounding areas in the neighbourhood and Mexico City in general, plus given printed maps and emergency contact info. We will be staying there again during our next visit to Mexico and highly recommend this place for a short or long stay."

They are lovely, generous, kind hearted and helpful people who go above and beyond to make their guests feel at home. We stayed there for an extended period, and felt extremely lucky to have fallen into the best house in Chapultepec. The house itself is a short lovely stroll to Condesa and Roma, very close to Metro stations and bus routes, is 2 minutes from a supermarket, and there is the lovely big Chapultepec park with museums and galleries in it. I highly recommend this place to anyone wanting a homely pad to call home when in Mexico city. I am proud to now consider them part of my International family. "

Paco was extremely professional - giving details on transportation, including taxi and day-hire driver #'s, restaurant recommendations, and wifi setup. \r\n\r\nThe room was large enough for two persons with luggage and included a television, desk, wardrobe, and double bed (maybe queen?). \r\n\r\nThe feel of the place was as if you were staying with an old friend - I felt very well taken care of. The house was spacious and well located between two bustling neighborhoods, but still in a very quiet and safe part of town.\r\n\r\nI made the booking last minute (day before) - Paco responded quickly and made himself available for our arrival.\r\n\r\nHighly recommended."

While San Miguel Chapultepec is not the most happening neighborhood, it is a calm, quiet, and convenient area, with easy access to most sites of interest.  The house has excellent security as well as an adorable, friendly dog.  I wholeheartedly recommend staying here!"

Zoals Paco zijn huis aan ons beschikbaar stelde hebben we zeer gewaardeerd je weet per slot van rekening nooit wie je in huis haalt. Het huis ligt mooi in het centrum zodat je met een taxi voor een paar cent overal naar toe wordt gereden.

The house is beatiful, and quite literally an oasis in the middle of the city, you will not hear anything. Internet works great around the house, fast enough to do video calling without any issues. Location was safe, there were a few restaurants and supermarkets around the area. \r\n\r\nAs host, Paco and his wife were extremely helpful and very friendly.,For instance,  a prepaid cellphone was in the room in case I needed it, a card to use on the metrobus, and very much willing to answer any questions. The housekeeper was also very much willing to go out of her way to help me out, staying late waiting for me on the first day, because I arrived later than anticipated.\r\n\r\nAdd to that some very friendly (and cute) dogs, breakfast in the morning, and it's an amazing value. \r\n\r\nHighly recommended, ideal for solo business travelers or couples doing tourism. \r\n"

He was very helpful in our getting acquainted with the city and all it has to offer. Yolanda was especially friendly and generous throughout the week, cleaning our room daily (even on the weekend!) and washing and folding our laundry upon request. It was great having the company of their dogs as well, who took to us immediately and greeted us upon our return home every afternoon and evening.\r\n\r\nOverall a great experience we recommend. Paco and Maria Jose's home was a perfectly safe and comfortable hub for our first visit to the DF. We will be back."

They are both perfect hosts and the same is true for Yolanda whose attention for guests is marvellous!  I was very pleased to know them. The services offered have been mentioned and described by other guests and they were offered to me, too, of course! It was a wonderful and pleasant experience to stay at the beautiful and calm place in the very loud and busy metropolis. It is also a very nice and safe neighborhood from were you can easily access Condesa or other parts of the city by Metrobus, Metro or walking. I highly recommend this place for other people visiting D.F. and I hope for myself to get the opportunity to come back!   "

The room was incredibly cozy and Paco and Maria Jose could not have been nicer. They provided us with a cell phone and a bus transit card. The wifi was consistent and useful for (Hidden by Airbnb) communication, which I used a couple of times. Paco had great suggestions for restaurants and activities. Maria Jose was very kind and helpful. Both are very busy professionals, so we really appreciated the time that they took with us.  Yolanda was there every day to make breakfast. She also took such great care with our room. Just wonderful people."

Although we had both traveled widely around Mexico, she had never visited D. F. She had also never booked a room through Airbnb.com. \r\n\r\nWe both had a fabulous time. We took Paco's suggestion and went to Xochimilco for a boat ride, among other things. There is so much to see in Mexico City that it was good to have someone to help narrow down the possibilities. Mom loved the house, especially the two dogs. \r\n\r\nYolanda, as always, was an indispensable part of the experience. Every day, there was a new arrangement to the breakfast table or bedroom. Maria Jose was also very helpful and kind.\r\n\r\nI would recommend to anyone visiting Mexico that Airbnb, and particularly this place, is a superior choice over a hotel. I hope that we can return the hospitality some day, either in Atlanta, or Louisiana.\r\n"

For the specifics read on below (other travelers speak to many details of the hospitality and the house).  A few thoughts: the house is if anything more beautiful than the photos. San Miguel Chapultapec is a great choice as a neighborhood to stay in (especially with Maria Jose and Paco) - it's very convenient to transit (metro and metrobus); has all the conveniences you would need (e.g. supermarkets, Sanborns, restaraunts, taco stands, etc.); it's near many spots you might want to visit (Chapultapec Park, La Condesa, Roma, etc.) but is very calm and almost tranquil. If you're looking for a homestay with a wonderful Mexican family, I can't imagine finding a better option.  "

Everything from the easy directions to the house, guidance notes (they were away when I arrived) and the thoughtful birthday breakfast, complete with balloons, cake and a singing candle, they arranged for me on my first morning in Mexico. Their housekeeper Yolanda is a star, always greeting me with a smile and breakfasts designed to fattening me up. And I fell in love with their dogs who spent each night stretched outside my bedroom door. When I did meet Francisco and his wife, it was like meeting old friends. All in all they made my first trip to Mexico a wonderfully memorable experience and I can't wait to return. My advice - stop searching for a place to stay in Mexico City, this is the place, book now - you won't regret it."

They were generous hosts who loved to visit although their work schedules often meant only in the evenings and weekends. They both spoke English very well. Housekeeper Yolanda (she spoke only Spanish) prepared an excellent breakfast which always included something hot in addition to many extras. The two dogs were fun. The photographs and the description of the house on the Airbnb website are very accurate and they deserve all the positive reviews. The neighborhood was quiet save for the big jets that passed over the city but this would happen regardless of where you stay. Perhaps it was a quiet because a convent was across the street. \r\nOur hosts left the house around 7:30 to 8:00 in the morning for work and breakfast was provided around 8:30 but it could be later if you want to sleep in longer. \r\nThe house was roomy with two floors. Downstairs were the living area rooms and the kitchen. There were two upstairs rooms they rent out although they usually only rent out one at a time so they can give more attention to their guests. Occasionally a relative might stay in the other guest room. Our host's bedroom was also upstairs and they were very quiet about leaving in the mornings. \r\nWe had their approval to use the entire house including the kitchen. We did not use their TV although we had permission to do so but we did use their computer once. Paco kindly printed off our boarding passes the day before our departure. \r\nOur room included a very good double bed, extra single loft bed, sofa, desk and chair, lots of wardrobe and drawers, and a large window that overlooked their backyard. Just outside the bedroom was the bathroom and also a sitting room which we often used before retiring. Yolanda provided us with clean towels each day and tidied up our room. \r\nThis home stay was very affordable, especially considering the quality and comforts of their place and the breakfast.  The house was about a ten minute brisk walk to four different metro stations, two minutes from a metrobus stop, and other bus runs. There were also places to eat that were a short walk away, two grocery stores, and other shops. The location was also a short walk from the nice streets and restaurants in the La Condesa neighborhood and not too far away from Chapultapec Park. With a walk to the metro you were never far away from anyplace in the city.  \r\nWe loved our eight day stay with this \"Best House\" and visiting with our hosts plus it was a very affordable place to stay. There is nothing that could have improved our stay. We would certainly stay there again, partly because the place is so great and also because there is so much to see and do in Mexico City and in eight days we only scratched the surface.  \r\n"

So it really helps to find a warm, comfortable and relaxing place that offers a respite from the hubbub of the big city. At the home of Francisco and Maria Jose we did indeed find such a sanctuary. The house is beautifully furnished and cozy and is perfectly suited to a traveling Bohemian. All the necessary creature comforts are here including nice linens, a comfortable bed, a laundry service, and a delicious warm breakfast. The unexpected and hugely welcome extra was the mobile phone the hosts provide to their guests which proves to be a life saver. Francisco and Maria Jose are also very helpful when it comes to helping the visitor gets their bearings in this tumultuous city. We got great advice on anything from memorable cultural experiences to help with taxis to the different destinations around town. The joy of AirBNB is discovering an unexpected jewel of a home in a far-away land and Francisco and Maria Jose's home is absolutely the epitome of fantastic AirBNB experience. "

They are great hosts; very caring - I have so much to say so let me put that in points :)\r\n\r\n- Well the care starts right from your initial queries about the booking because Paco will give all sorts of advice for your itinerary and other tips needed for your trip in Mexico. \r\n\r\n- We had one more friend who planned his trip later; Paco helped us with his accommodation at his friends place and his move.\r\n\r\n- The house is very big and beautiful; just as in pictures. There is a big living room which you can use and kitchen for your needs.\r\n\r\n- The breakfast that Yolanda prepares is good to kick start your day - especially the cheese omelette and fresh juice and fruits.\r\n\r\n- There are many guide books available for your stay in Mexico city; do look at the one with pictures of Mexico city - will definitely inspire you to add few more places in your itinerary.\r\n\r\n- They gave a local mobile phone to use - very handy to call taxi or call back Paco if stuck somewhere.\r\n\r\n- Paco even helped us with buying bus tickets as there was some problem buying them online - yet another way to show care for their guests.\r\n\r\nSome more things to know:\r\n\r\n- The house is connected by 2 metro stations nearby but we used taxi most of the times as it was convenient and not very expensive. Around 40-50 pesos to go to Zocalo or around if you get the right cab person.\r\n\r\n- Go to nearby Condesa area for trendy bars and restaurants for dinner.\r\n\r\n- Do take the map printout that Paco hands to you as it is helpful to tell the taxi driver where to take (especially if you don't know Spanish)"

Close to transport (bus, Metrobus, Metro, taxi traffic) and utilities (grocery store, pharmacy, hospital, etc.), Chapultepec park, Parque Lira, and La Condesa; but also on a quiet side street. Paco and Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 were wonderful hosts, and their dogs are sweet, quiet, and well-behaved. Breakfasts are tasty and included in the stay, as is laundry and room cleaning. "

Even though we only stayed two nights, Paco made sure to suggest the best things to do while we were there- without him we wouldn't have known about the Bike day, the last Sunday of the month, when many major streets are closed so only bikes can cruise through. He printed out maps for each area, and let us use his computer to check our email and print our boarding passes. He really cares about his guest's comfort and security. The house was lovely, quiet, clean and welcoming. Mexico city however is full of busy, almost freeway like roads, so walking to Condesa requires some skillful road crossing, or pedestrian bridge use from their house. Otherwise, highly recommended."

It's conveniently located to many of the metro stations.  They provided me with a metro card and even a basic cellphone.\r\n\r\nTheir house maid, Yolanda, does your laundry, folds it, and leaves it in a plastic bag in your bedroom.  She puts out a beautiful breakfast each morning with cereal, muffins, coffee, tea, fresh squeezed orange juice, fruit salad,   \r\n\r\nTheir dogs are playful, well-trained, and friendly.  \r\n\r\nThey even called a cab for me to take me to the airport when I left.

Moy walked with us to the nearby neighborhood of la Condesa which has beautiful tree lined streets and lots of restaurants and bars.  Paco and Maria Jose\u2019s home is a lovely escape from the busy city and is a reflection of their great taste in art and architecture.  Breakfast magically appeared every morning through the capable hands of Yolanda.

I didn't speak Spanish and she didn't speak much English. I told her I needed to eat dinner. She took a few blocks away and showed me where to eat.\r\nThe next morning Paco gave me some good travel tips including a visit to the Museo Soumaya which wasn't on my list of things to see. He also gave me his city share bike card so I could ride around the city like a local which was fun and scary at the same time.\r\nThe house is quite nice with beautiful art all around, a outdoor garden, and a spacious living space.

Magically breakfast appears on the table with something for everyone including fresh fruit, cereal, yogurt, cake, bread, coffee and juices. She even does your laundry! Leave a nice tip. \r\n\r\nThere is a market/grocery store 2 blocks away as you are welcome to use the kitchen and entire home. The location is great for Chapultepec Park (walk through, go to the Museuam of Anthropology, The Castle and out onto La Reforma and the Angel of Independence). Great for Polanco and Condesa areas and even Zona Rosa as taxi's are very cheap however; YOU MUST HAVE A GPS or MAP (my Garmin was invaluable - and free) of where you want to go. There are 250,000 taxi driver's and none know the whole city. This house was very difficult for them to find so we often just walked in from the market on the main st. If you have your GPS (phone or other) you can also track the taxi as you ride along. Use the taxi service number that Paco gives you. But be ready. They show up immediately. \r\n\r\nThe dogs are very well behaved but my friend had allergies so...\r\n\r\nMexico City was not as warm as I had originally thought as it is 2500m above sea level. The homes are not heated and sometimes it was cool as it was also rainy season.\r\n\r\nThe altitude 'sickness' hit this fit West Coast girl hard as far as climbing stairs; short of breath and light headedness.\r\n\r\nEat at Nu Trete, Maria's favorite and mine too. The bar across the street from there has excellent music and vibe at night. \r\n\r\nJune 2013 - 6 nights "

We are happy to add yet another great review to their profile!\r\nAlthough we only stayed with them for one night, it was amazing to see that everything we'd read about them was just as described!  From their house, their warmth and tremendous hospitality and commitment to make you feel right at home.\r\nFrom the very first moment we arrived, Maria Jose personally took us for a walk around the neighborhood (by the way, great location, conveniently connected to all major points in the city), to make sure we knew where everything was and how to get to the metro and bus stations - she took us for this walkabout even as she had clearly just arrived home from a long day at work!\r\n\r\nYolanda, the housekeeper was also fantastic!! She helped us with our suitcases and had a fresh breakfast ready for us in the morning. \r\nPaco greeted us at night, after we came back from dinner, and made sure we had everything we needed in our room, including fresh linens, bottled water, and instructions on how to lock the house with our own set of keys.\r\nAside all these, which falls within what we already knew about them through the reviews, what impacted us most about them was the fact that even after our sudden change in plans, they made sure we were OK, and kept in touch with us by letting us keep their cellphone. \r\nOverall, the only thing I regret from this experience, is not being able to stay with them longer!! We truly recommend them. :)"

A wonderful place in a very safe and quiet area but close to public transport, Chapultepec and Condesa, that will exceed your expectations. Highly recommended, the best choice for your stay in Mexico City."

They are so generous with their time,helping you navigate your way around and providing excellent recommendations for places to see and eat. Yolanda is wonderful also and we really are grateful to all here for making our stay so enjoyable. The house is stunning and the area has a lovely vibe and close to so much of the sites to see. The dogs are also a treat to be around. We will return for sure!"

Yolanda also was very kind to all of us. Actually it was a really cool experience because we really felt like in our house: we enjoyed a delicious breakfast every morning and meals in the large garden.\r\nI definitely recommend their home if you think about going to Mexico City, you will have a very comfortable bed to rest after a long walk, you can cook something in the beautiful kitchen (or just eat \"tlayudas\" and \"quesadillas\" in a place two blocks away!). It's well connected to nearby metro stations and only blocks away to metrobus.\r\n\r\nWe really enjoyed our time at Maria and Pacos's houes!"

Upon arriving we were greeted warmly with coffee and biscuits, and given a very useful briefing on which sites ought to be visited, and the history behind each one.  Just a few blocks away is an amazing restaurant called La Poblanita, serving traditional cuisine from Puebla and Yucatan.  The mole and cochinita pibil were to die for, and inexpensive. \r\nThank you Francisco, Maria, y Yolanda for everything, and I hope we meet again soon.   Muchas Gracias!"

It's clear from the moment you step in that their home is maintained very well, and that they are invested in making their guests feel welcomed and secure in Mexico City. The neighborhood is quiet and lovely, with a few good local spots to eat. They are right under Bosque Chapultepec, and the 7 Metro line at Constituyentes (I would avoid going to  the Tacubaya stop- can be very confusing). \r\n\r\nI would say that if you are looking for a quiet, centralized place to have as a homebase to explore DF from, Paco and Maria Jose's place is very hard to beat- value, location, warm and helpful hosts, safety- absolutely nothing not to like. Praise all around.      "

I stayed in the white room but was able to wander around the house, use the kitchen if I wanted and enjoyed breakfasts made by the lovely Yolanda.  The house is very quiet, located just a bit down from a main street, so once you get your bearings, always very easy to find.    I really enjoyed my stay there, but had to leave after just a few days to attend spanish school in Morelia.

Now we are in Costa Rica and they are taking care for some of our stuff.\n\nThe house is absolutely great. Beside the hosts, the two dogs and the cleaning ladys are lovely too. The surrounding area is safe and all main sightseeing points are whether are short walk, bike ride or a short taxi ride away.\nWe had a great room with ensuite WC, Flatscreen and lots of space. Breakfast is served daily. Also a cellphone, free bycycle cards and lots of recommondations for getting around are included in the price.\n\nWe loved the big free mexico city zoo in the huge parque next to their area.\n\nWe are looking forward to see Paco&Maria again and would choose them as our hosts again without any doubt everytime we would return to Mexico City."

Both Francisco and Marie Jose go out of their way to ensure you have a comfortable and safe stay, guiding you to the best that Mexico City has to offer. I would urge future guests to immediately experience the Condessa neighborhood, a 20 peso ride away, and filled with small restaurants, stores, lots of green, and a great place to walk and watch others walk their dogs. If you are too tired after a great day in Mexico, walk out of the house to the right, turn left for 1 block, and cross the street to a terrific street vendor halfway down on the other side that made wonderful hot and healthy chicken dishes to eat at his stand or carry home. He's always there.  "

As this was our first trip to Mexico and we speak only ten words of Spanish we needed some \"hand holding\" at the beginning.  We were walked to the subway (metro) station, shown how to buy tickets, how to navigate, loaned a cell phone just in case, and then never looked back.  We were subsequently able to travel all over town to different places and back at all hours and thus make the most of our eight day stay.  Our hosts also made sure safe and reasonable taxis showed up for other trips and the airport.\r\n\r\nBreakfasts were a pleasant buffet of cereal, fruit, yoghurt, coffee and tea and available until 11:00 a.m. for the jet-lagged.  \r\n\r\nAlthough we are not normally fans of dogs in the house these two were friendly to guests and so well cared-for there was not a dog hair in sight.  They also added to the sense of security to the place.\r\n\r\nIt was also very nice of our relaxed hosts to invite their guests into other parts of the house so that we never felt constrained to the bedroom, comfortable as it  common was.\r\n\r\nThank you Francisco and Maria Jose and Maya plus small friend and also the pleasant house staff.  We would definitely like to come back."

We were debating between staying at a hotel or in this house and I am very glad that we chose to stay here and next time we are in Mexico City, my wife and I will stay in the same place.\r\nHere are a few reasons:\r\n1. The location is excellent.  Great neighborhood, strategically located for easy access to the metro, transportation and the city's most interesting places.\r\n2. Accommodations are fantastic.  The bed was great, the rooms and bathrooms were clean and maintained daily and every morning breakfast was waiting for us.  Great value for the money.\r\n3. Hosts were fantastic.  Communication before we arrived was consistent, clear and timely and they were able to work with our fluid schedule.  After we arrived, Paco made sure that our stay went as well as possible and spent time to sit with us and explain the city and give us the basics to get all out of our stay in Mexico.\r\n4. The extra touches like having a cell phone waiting for us to use, contacts with reliable taxi drivers, maps available to us and restaurant recommendations really made our stay.  We could not have had this sort of personalized service at a hotel.\r\n\r\nI strongly recommend staying here. "

Their home is as lovely as it appears in the photos and is located in a charming residential area not far from most of the districts that visitors would be likely to visit.  The most special aspect of the stay was the help Paco provided in giving us recommendations, advice and assistance from the beginning to the end of our trip. He really went above and beyond to make sure that we had a great trip in Mexico City and a comfortable stay in his and Maria Jose's home, and we are so grateful for this.  I will definitely stay with Paco and Maria Jose again and recommend this house to any prospective travellers without any hesitation. This was probably my best airbnb experience so far. "

Upon our arrival in the D.F. we stayed in an apartment in the Centro Hist\u00f3rico (because Paco and Maria's was not available those days), and I can say without a doubt that our apartment experience does not compare to that of San Miguel. Staying with natives of the DF will always provide a superior trip to Mexico if those natives are as kind as easy to relate to as Paco and Maria. My husband and three children shared two rooms over our stay. My husband stayed a week and my children (age 10, 13, and nearly 15) and I stayed approximately 3 weeks. This house is located in a nice, quiet, safe, convenient neighborhood. It is close to Chapultepec Park, a huge grocery store (that has just about anything), several metro stops, and many restaurants. The space and home are expansive and beautiful as shown in the pictures. We never felt cramped in this space, in fact, it felt much roomier than our own home. I can tell you that by the end of the stay, the neighborhood and the house felt like home to us, and the dogs (Maya and Copit) felt like our own. That was largely due to our warm, generous, caring hosts. Paco and Maria were more than generous with the use of the house, the refrigerator, their movies (ha), and their time. They gave us a cell phone, answered any question, and helped us in every necessary instance. It is clear that they wanted us to have the best of possible stays, and in fact we did. The stay felt relaxed, allowing us our independence, while providing safety and support whenever we needed it. I really could not imagine a better place to stay in Mexico City. Paco and Maria are a lovely couple that we really enjoyed getting to know over several weeks. They are intelligent, funny, patient, down-to-earth, and genuinely great hosts. To be honest we were all sad to say goodbye to them and we will miss them here in Chicago. If you are looking for a place that feels like home away from home, you have found it. \u00a1Much\u00edsimas gracias por todo Paco and Maria!"

However, they have a \"make yourself at home\" attitude and it worked out great.  They provided a cell phone, a great map, keys, etc. to help us out during our stay.  The dogs were always well behaved and became our friends by the end of our stay who always greeted us when we came home.  The breakfast is simple but delicious and a great way to start your day.  The location is great, walking distance to the main park and to some great food areas.  I never felt unsafe, day or not, near there place (or anywhere else really).   Four of us went, we are all very easy going and it was nice to have a set of easy going homeowners as well.  Everything stated on the listing is what you get, if we venture back to Mexico City I wouldn't hesitate to stay with Paco and Maria Jose again.  Thanks for everything!"

Our hosts were very personable and provided personalized, helpful suggestions on how to get around, places to go, etc. They provided us with a local cell phone and laminated map of the city, which were very helpful. All this made our stay in Mexico City much easier and more enjoyable.\r\nThe house has three stories: the ground floor, which includes the common rooms (kitchen, dining, living) and a nice backyard with a patio table; the second floor, where there are three guest rooms (large master with its own bathroom, two smaller bedrooms, and a shared bath). Paco and Maria stay on the third floor. They have two friendly dogs--one a big Saint Bernard, which mostly stay downstairs. The location is in a quiet neighborhood south of the Bosque de Chapultepec, walking distance to the park and its museums, and the adjacent neighborhood of Condessa and some really excellent restaurants on Avenida Michoacan. Paco and Maria provide a nice breakfast (fruit, toast, cereal, yogurt, etc.) every morning. This house was a great home base during our visit and a provided a welcome respite from commotion of one of the world's biggest cities."

In my message to Paco I motioned I was interested in renting his house and I did not understand we were going to be sharing the house with other guests or the owners . I am always very careful in accurately disclosing the number of people in the party and the arrival and departure times in order to align expectations and corresponding costs with the owner. In my experience renting large whole places, the owner has locked those rooms that will not be used and only leave available the corresponding ones so when Paco confirmed the rooms that would be made available I thought this was also going to be the case. In the end it all worked out perfectly besides this misunderstanding. Paco was very accommodating to our requests for information, needs such as parking space, towels, cradle for our daughter etc. The pictures on their add represented accurately what the house looked like (awesome place). Even the dogs were in the picture and they happened to be the mellower lovelier pets we have come across, absolutely fantastic for us since we happen to love dogs. The house was undergoing general improvement works and there were construction workers and material but none of that got in the way or had a negative impact. It is always nice to see that a plaice is being properly maintained.  I was able to communicate with Paco via Watsapp for any questions. I casually met him and his lovely wife a couple of times in the kitchen and had a very pleasant chat with them always. I would deffinately recommend it to my friends and would most certainly consider staying again with Paco and Maria Jose. I am thankful to Paco and Maria Jose for having us and wish them the best of luck as hosts of their beautiful home. "

The house itself is situated in a desirable location of the city and very close to Chapultepec Park, there was plenty of amenities nearby and it was very safe to walk around. \r\n\r\nThe house itself is as nice and welcoming as pictured they do go out of their way to make visitors from all over the world comfortable in the house. This included the nice artwork within the house and of course the dogs as pictured, others have mentioned are very well trained and simple great to be around and this is coming from a cat person.  The hosts were out of town for the most part during my stay but all provisions were well looked after. This included the service of the maids who are kind and very useful around the house. In the mornings whilst they are around breakfast is laid out to fuel your day of travel. \r\n\r\nI would most certainly visit this enchanting house again if in the city."

They have a private attached room with a separate entrance. Paco was extremely helpful with suggestions to make our stay in Mexico City even better than planned. They made us feel welcome in their home right from the beginning. They provided us local mobile phones, which we didn't need but was thoughtful. Their two dogs have the run of the house and they're so sweet -- Maya, the St. Bernard, even slept in one of our rooms all weekend.\r\n\r\nThe house is very large, was very clean, and is situated in a very quiet neighborhood just south of Chapulapec Park. It's a short walk to the park and it's near 4 metro stations.  If we weren't walking, we mostly used Uber, however, because it was so convenient and a relatively cheap way to get around town (plus, it avoids having to bargain with and feel ripped off by taxi drivers.)  Paco and Maria provided continental breakfast for us every morning, which we didn't expect but was a nice touch.  \r\n\r\nIn short, if you have a lot of people and you want a quiet place to retreat to, this is a great spot.  We had 8 people in the house, which was very comfortable at 2 adults per room, but the house sleeps quite a few more, if you're okay with being cozy (3-4 per room.) We would definitely like to rent the house again on future visits.\r\n"

There is a beautiful garden in the house, so visitors can lie in the chairs and relax themselves. Every morning, we can have breakfast in the kitchen, and when the owners of the house noticed that the basket of apples was nearly empty, they brought a big bag of apples in the evening. Besides, the owners also led us a mobile phone with local Mexican number, so we can communicate with the taxi drivers or the owners conveniently. Our room is cleaned every day, and living here is like living in a luxurious hotel. Actually, the best part of our experience is that the owners of the house are so nice! One day, we saw a ballet show and it was nearly 10 pm, the owners waited us outside the theater and drove us to the house. When we asked them to recommend us the scenes, they gave us the map and helped us connect with the taxi driver. The driver is also great, and he accompanied us all day long, and the price is relatively cheaper than those normally. When we visited in the pyramid, the driver waited us outside for four hours. The dogs in the house are really cute, and they always sleep quietly on the stairs. In conclusion, I definitely recommend this house and I will live there again if I visit Mexico in the future! p(#\u00af\u25bd\u00af#)o "

There is plenty of space, we had coffee and breakfast waiting in the kitchen every morning, and (no better way to describe it), always felt at home. My brother and our friends stayed here for a long weekend in July, all of us visiting Mexico City for the first time. Paco sat down with us on the first night and gave us detailed recommendations and directions for sights and food. We walked easily from the house to Chapultepec, Condesa, and Roma. He also put us in touch with his friend who drove us to Teotihuacan one morning. The comforts of the house added so much to our stay, and we can't wait to be back. Gracias para todo, Paco y Maria. "

Paco and Maria Jose were welcoming, gracious, and informative hosts. Breakfasts were tasty and the location was perfect for accessing galleries and museums in the areas we were concerned with. They conveniently arranged a local mobile phone for use during our stay, airport pickup, and a ride to Teotihuacan on the day we departed. My only complaint is that we had to come back to the states! Would have loved to stay longer in this wonderful place.  Thanks Paco and Maria Jose! We'll be back."

The area is safe and convenient.  If I return to Mexico City I would definitely stay here again.  They get 5 stars from me.    They even provided a cell phone for us to use while in the city.  Very handy to have a phone as we needed to call our driver to pick us up during our tours of the city.  Don't hesitate to stay here, you won't be disappointed.  If you do stay here and you don't feel like heading out too far for dinner you should try La Poblanita de Tacobaya.  Take a left as you exit the house then take your 1st left at the corner and head down 2 blocks.  Restaurant is on your left.  Very good food.  Also, there's a very good burger place directly across from La Poblanita.  The Bayou.  Kind of a hipster small burger joint.  Let me tell you, I think I had one of the best burgers I ever had there.  We ate there one night as La Poblanita closed at 7pm.  Thank you Paco and Maria for providing an awesome place to stay.  I hope to see you guys again.\r\n\r\nRich"

Unfortunately, our hosts were out of town during our stay though the caretaker and maids made us feel very welcome as did their two great dogs. \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood was very quaint, quiet, and residential, and we felt plenty safe walking around (except the route to the Tacubaya Metro stop felt less comfortable). It is relatively close to neighborhoods with more \"action\" at about a 15-20 minute walk or 5 minute Uber ride. Here is where this host lost some points in our book:\r\n- We were unaware that they would not be at the house during our stay, although they were quick to communicate via the Air BNB app regarding any concerns. Still would have liked to meet them though. \r\n- The wi-fi would not work in our 3rd story room. \r\n- The shower water-pressure was basically non-existent.\r\n- No heat or A/C in our room.\r\n- The outdoor spiral staircase to our room was unexpected.\r\n \r\nI like to think things would have been a bit more smooth had they been home during our stay, though our complaints are minor and we had an incredible trip to D.F!"

How does it get better? You have the comfort of being in a space where you feel comfortable and at home. The location was very convenient to get around the rest of the city. Plus, they have the most wonderful dogs, so if you have to leave your own four legged friends at home, they make great substitute companions. When traveling to Mexico City, you must stay here. I would consider Paco & Maria Jose friends and look forward to visiting them again in the future. My boyfriend and I even get engaged on this trip and they left us roses and champagne in our room!

We were met at the airport by a driver Paco arranged which allowed us to skip the assault of taxis and car rentals as we exited with our bags. My son was quite sick when we arrived and Paco welcomed us and helped care for him. I felt at ease and grateful to be met with such care. The house was exactly as pictured, beautiful and warm with two sweet dogs to make us feel at home.The weather was unusually cold and rainy and Paco provided us with a space heater since there is no heat. He welcomed us with all the info we needed, maps, restaurant recommendations, and directions to local grocery and atm. Breakfast was generous and made available bright and early, and we had clean sheets every day!\r\nPaco and Marie Jose are lovely and gracious hosts with a fabulous home  in a great location. They made every effort to make sure we were happy and had everything we needed. I hope to return again someday. I highly recommend this home!"

Our flight landed early that morning, and they sent a driver, Gabriel, to pick up us and drop off our bags while our room was set up. Paco greeted us and handed us a local cell phone as well as a break-down of suggestions to do in the city each day. We would have honestly been lost without these two. San Miguel Chapultepec is such a beautiful part of the city, so close to the enormous Bosque with wonderful museums. You could walk about a mile east and check out the row of restaurants and bars in Condesa. We got to use the bike system to ride down to the Historic District with no issues. Maria arranged for us to get to Teotihuacan to check out the pyramids for an additional cost. Their two dogs are so sweet, we gave them many hugs and kisses. We managed to navigate our way to Coyoacan as well, and there are metro stations close-by their home to hop on and ride away. We made our way around Mexico City on foot with no issues, because of the advice that these two gave us. Their home is beautiful and artsy, and the room up the spiral staircase was comfortable, clean and private with a patio and hammock (!) however it was very bright in the morning, so pack a sleeping mask if you don't want the sunlight to wake you! A light breakfast is offered, juice, coffee, cereal and fruit, which was very nice. By the time we got back to the house, our room was cleaned and the bed was made, so that was a nice perk. Everyone else that stayed in the home seemed to respect each other and the common areas were kept clean. Paco and Maria are genuine and helpful and I'm glad to have met them! Our stay with them made our trip to Mexico City perfect, and if we head back, I will be sure to stay with them again. THANK YOU!!"

Their house is very big and tastefully decorated. I personally think it's a very secure house. I have no complain what so ever with my room. It was very cosy, and the bed was very comfortable. They provide cold breakfast in the kitchen in the morning. They set everything up very nicely on their grand dining table. O yeah, they also have maid cleaning my room every day. But what makes the stay much more pleasant is their two four-legged pets. Two very adorable dogs (a St Bernard and a small dog). They greeted me as soon as I walked in to the house, after a long day exploring the city. It was very comforting and it made me feel right at home.\r\nSo for all travellers out there, I highly recommend staying with Paco and Maria for your next trip to Mexico City. You won't be disappointed."

Given we were travelling for a wedding, we were a large group and thought it would be most enjoyable to be able to stay in a more home-like setting \u2013 fortunately Maria and Paco were willing to host our large group, so we booked our first Airbnb accommodation ever. \r\n\r\nRight from the time we booked online Maria and Paco were very responsive and helpful. Anytime we had a question it was answered almost immediately. Their flexible check-in time meant no waiting around after our flight and we were able to settle in right away. The house itself is beautiful and allowed us to spend evenings together as a family. As an added bonus, Maria and Paco\u2019s housekeeper Justina was kind enough to wash our clothes, make beds, and clean the dishes so we could just focus on enjoying our time in Mexico City \u2013 I only hope we didn\u2019t keep her too busy. \r\n\r\n The surrounding neighbourhood had everything we needed in close proximity \u2013 restaurants, cafes, supermarket, subway stations \u2013 and was within walking distance to what was the most important attraction for our family with young children: Chapultapec Park. We were fortunate to have new in-laws in Mexico City to give us advice and help us to navigate, but Paco was quick to provide advice and assistance whenever requested. I would recommend Paco and Maria as hosts should anyone I know travel to Mexico City. Thank you Paco and Maria. \r\n"

We were a large group, and prior to our arrival Paco and Maria walked me through every aspect of our stay, from airport pickups, to pyramid trips, to dinners, which was fantastic! They have a beautiful home, better than the pictures! And everything about the stay in the house was perfect. Paco and Maria really go out of their way to make sure that you enjoy your stay in their house and Mexico City. You have everything you need. I will be staying with them on my future trips back to Mexico City, it felt like a home away from home.  "

It's beautiful, private, clean, comfortable, filled with interesting art, and in a great neighborhood. We walked to restaurants, parks, museums, and nightlife, and found public transportation to be easy to access as well. The best thing about staying with Maria and Paco, however, was their attentiveness and help in finding what we needed. We highly recommend their home for an enjoyable visit to Mexico City, and we look forward to returning!"

Had a lot of fun with the two lovely dogs which we will miss a lot. A few minutes walk get you to a supermarket and restaurants. 10-15 minutes get you to some very trendy restaurants.\nBoth Maria and Francisco speak excellent English. Maria gave us a warm welcome and clear instructions of directions. They gave us a mobile phone which meant much convenience. Our laundry was also done during house cleaning. We used the car service to and from the airport and to do a day trip to see the pyramids. Their driver, Gabrielle, was polite. Overall an excellent stay. Will surely choose this place again if we visit Mexico City again."

There were 15 of us attending my son's boda and we were lucky to stay at Francisco & Maria's 2 homes.  They are beautiful, private, comfortable, and close to some of the best areas in Mexico City - restaurants, parks, museums, anything you may want.  They also offer a driver, Gabriel who was terrific - so convenient and so affordable.  With 15 of us, we were so grateful to have his services.  \nAs mentioned, we stayed in 2 homes and they are both wonderful but very different.  The mansion is the original home in the area and is truer to its long history in terms of furnishings and decor.  The other has been totally redone and is more modern - choose the one that best suits your aesthetic.  \0d one cannot review these homes without mentioning the help and attentiveness of our hosts, Francisco & Maria.  They are a wealth of information about the city, its attractions, restaurants, markets and shopping.\nYou would be very lucky to have the opportunity to stay at one of their airbnbs."

This was my first time using Airbnb and my family was a little hesitant at first (there were 8 of us total), but by the end of our trip we had fallen in love with both the city and this house. The pictures that are posted really don't do the house justice. The facade of the house and the street leading up to it aren't particularly impressive, but the moment the gate opens up you are greeted not only by an absolutely beautiful 3 story home, but also by his awesome dogs. The house is very spacious with more than enough room for a large family plus friends. Francisco and his family live on the property, but in separate living quarters. This means that you might see them once in a while and if you have any issues they're always right there to help with anything you need. \n\nFrancisco himself was an incredible host. Even before our trip he was always responded promptly to my messages. He offered to send his driver pick us up from the airport, all 8 of us, which was great. Once we arrived at his home, he gave us a tour of the property and then sat us all down and showed us on a map where the house was in relation of all of the important spots in Mexico City. We saw him almost everyday and he always asked how everything was going and if we needed anything. If you choose to have him pick you up you'll also meet his driver Gabriel. We wanted to visit the pyramids of Teotihuacan and a few other spots, so Gabriel offered to rent a large van and drive all of use around the entire day! It was so much better than paying a tour company. \n\nThe location of the house is also very good. We walked to the Castle of Chapultepec (El castillo de chapultepec) and el museo de antropologia. For anything else, a quick and inexpensive Uber ride will get you where you need to go.  Overall, we had an amazing time in Mexico City and I'm glad I decided to stay in Francisco's home. I would recommend this place to all of my family and friends."

Francisco couldn't have been more helpful.....and Maria Jose had just had a baby!  Everything was better than expected, everyone was very happy and they even let Maya (the huge St. Bernard) stay in my room....helped me as I missed my pups so very much.  towards the end of our stay the smaller dog (forgot name) warmed up to me as well.  We were surprised that the family is in the house as we thought they were in a separate \"in-law suite\" in the back of the property....or something.  In fact, the house is shared, hard to explain but they have their own suite of rooms within the house.  It was never an issue and we all very much enjoyed our stay.  The rooms and bathrooms were amazing and we had daily maid service.  I found the bed to be on the hard side but travel with my foam pad so it wasn't a problem.  Francisco explained that firmer meant better quality....  The rooms that were upstairs that had a small terrace were where some of my family stayed and they were so very happy with their rooms...again, only complaint were the firm beds.  I figured out how to get Netflix -loved the selection.  I know I'm always leery of a \"perfect\" (Website hidden by Airbnb) if there was one (Website hidden by Airbnb) had to be that all the doors and some windows were always open which was great except that in Mexico, there are no screens on the windows (anywhere) and usually it's not an issue but with climate change or whatever....the mosquitoes ate a few of us up.  NOT a fault of Francisco, just the only issue I had with our whole stay.  On our last night, I mentioned this to Francisco and he said he could have done something about it....I should have spoken up as they were the most accommodating hosts in every way.   The house is gorgeous and Francisco and Maria Jose are SUPER wonderful and very accommodating.  The neighborhood is super safe, I walked around on my own and with my boys at all hours and were always met with warm smiles.  There is a small neighborhood store that is open late and an ice cream place just close by in the neighborhood but you are very near a major road with an Oxxo, (like a 7-11) Pizza place,(really good pizza but slow service) restaurant (great service and good food) and two pharmacies all within walking distance. We-All 6 of us felt like we had been staying with family by the end and no one wanted to leave.  We all want to go back and will definitely stay with Francisco Carlos and his family if they will have us.  You can't go wrong, Francisco set us up with airport transport (Gabriel) and a very patient and friendly driver (Alberto).  They were both (Website hidden by Airbnb) don't hesitate, this place has it all and then some."

Francisco has a wonderful family and a really special home \u2014 he helped us coordinate our visit, reviewed our itinerary and offered helpful suggestions, and was overall a gracious and kind host. The home itself is in a small, quiet neighborhood that's centrally located with easy access to Roma Norte / Condesa as well as Bosque de Chapultepec. Our large group had no problems navigating the neighborhood. The home itself is beautiful \u2014 clean and comfortable and decorated with a remarkable art collection. Overall a really great experience. I highly recommend this Airbnb!"

They are wonderfully gracious people and welcomed six of us to their Mexico City home with amenities like a private ride into town from the airport, a driver to Teotihuacan and they even ordered tickets for us to the Frida Kahlo house when we couldn't buy them online outside of Mexico. \n\nThe house itself is beautiful and spacious. There are enough beds to comfortably sleep a ton of people and each room feels very private. The kitchen and patio make it easy to enjoy easy breakfasts in the morning and beers at night. Best of all, the two dogs (especially the St. Bernard) are eager to hang out with you. The home is walking distance from Condesa and Chapultepec park, which makes it easy to explore.\n\nI cannot recommend their home enough."

He arranged for his excellent driver, Gabriel, to handle airport transportation, as well as take us to the pyramids at Teotihuacan. And when we arrived, Francisco sat down with us and a map, and gave us detailed directions and advice on how to spend our time in Mexico City.\n\0d the place is incredible. It's situated on a quiet side street, facing a private courtyard (you share it and, occasionally, the kitchen with Francisco's lovely family, who live in an adjacent apartment, but were gone most of the time we were there). It's three stories, has been creatively renovated by Francisco himself, and includes a couple of spiral staircases, great decor, and a third-floor deck that I already miss. As a family of four, we didn't even use the second floor rooms. The two dogs are wonderful; even my wife, who's not exactly a dog person, got attached to Cupito and Maya.\n\nOh, and daily maid service is included (which I don't believe the listing states). \n\nWe loved Mexico City and wish we'd stayed longer. If we go back--and we certainly hope so--we'd love to stay at Francisco's place again."

Francisco was very helpful as we were planning our trip and also while we were in Mexico City.  His driver, Gabriel, was also a great help.  The house is amazing - great artwork, furniture that Francisco has made, large common spaces where we could relax.  If we come back to Mexico City (and we'd like to sometime) we'll definitely be back in touch."

We were a party of 6 and had almost too much room. Lol!! The house is decorated beautifully and is very clean. There is a housekeeper there everyday to clean and upkeep the house. She is sweet and unobtrusive. We had her make breakfast for us one day for a fee of $35USD for the 6 of us. We asked for chilaquiles. They were the best with homemade refried beans!!! My sister in law couldn\u2019t stop saying how amazing they were!! We did opt to have someone pick us up at the airport in their Suburban. It cost $35USD one way from the airport. An UBER probably would\u2019ve been cheaper but it was nice having us all together in one vehicle. The location of the house is good. It\u2019s too far from Downtown to walk but UBER is easy and cheap to use. There are many restaurants and grocery stores near by the house to eat if you don\u2019t want to go all the way downtown. I would definitely recommend this place if you are spending some days in Mexico City."

Great communication with our hosts throughout it all. They are attentive to our needs and the house staff was also accommodating and great. The house is basically a huge house divided with living headquarters for the hosts and the other half for guests. Plenty of bathrooms, rooms, couches, sitting areas, and beds for large groups. We were a group of 8 and it was perfect: 2 people per room. Two of the rooms are separated from the main house, meaning that you have to go outside and walk up stairs to get to them. Those two separate rooms have a private balcony with some chairs outside. The two other rooms are in the main house upstairs. The house comes with a cleaning lady whom I did not meet but appreciated how amazing our room was after coming home. Gabriel is the driver and he charges separately for day trips anywhere. We used his service for Teotihuac\u00e1n and it was perfect since he then took us to Coyoac\u00e1n after. We also used him for Xochimilco but in all honesty, we could have taken an Uber. Karina is the chef and she can cook you something for a small fee per person. The dogs (Maya & Copito) are just adorable and so loveable. I truly recommended this place for large groups."

It is an incredible space in a great, safe location. We were a group of 6 girls and a special feature of the house is that you really don't know if other people are awake, showering, talking, etc. due to the room layout (which is really nice when people are on different sleep schedules). Francisco was a very welcoming, easy host and helped all of us get settled, provided recommendations, etc.  The daily housekeeping was an added bonus -- it was nice to have a clean room to come back to after a day of exploring the city.  I hope to come back and stay here again."

I say estate because it is truly grand; the decor is beautiful, the art is one of a kind, and the space is very, very large. There were 10 of us staying there for a weekend and we had plenty of private and public areas. There are multiple bathrooms and we never had trouble showering or getting ready. The house is walking distance to several attractions in Condesa/Roma, or a very quick $2-3 USD uber ride to Polanco or Centro HIstorico. The home is behind a large gate with a door code so we never felt unsafe. It is a very private, quiet, pretty neighborhood. The BEST THING about this airbnb is that Francisco & Maria are EXTREMELY quick to respond and help you coordinate our trip. This was invaluable to us because we were coming from abroad. Just a heads up that the airbnb does include their two pet dogs - they are both very well trained and good mannered, but we did not realize that they would be in the airbnb. None of us had any problems with the dogs, but FYI for those of you who are allergic."

We especially enjoyed drinking our morning coffee on the upstairs terrace. Francisco went above and beyond to help ensure we had a great stay. We had breakfast cooked for the group one morning which was delicious and Gabriel the driver made the day trip to the Pyramids easy and convenient. The house is in a nice area and an easy Uber ride away to some of the other parts of the city we explored during our stay. I would highly recommend this place for anyone traveling with a large group. Also we never felt unsafe, the house is on a quite street behind a locked gate."

We had an excellent experience and I would definitely recommend staying here.\n\nThe family has a small staff of people who take care of the house so the house was always very clean and beds got made on a daily basis which was way beyond expectation for me. \n\nThe house is very beautiful, unique, and pretty quirky. There is art all over the house and the third story if the house is accessed through spiral staircases. It was definitely an interesting house in the best way possible.\n\nFrancisco was very helpful on the first day and gave us a map with good tips for things to do. Beyond that we didn't see much of the family, even though they do share a portion of the house. We never felt weird or awkward with them living close with a shared entrance.\n\nThe house is probably more than 3500 square feet on a gut estimate. It's a very big house. \n\nAgain, stay here if you are in Mexico City. It's a nice location and a beautiful house."

Paco, the owner, was helpful with tips and arranged that we use their driver for excursions.  Their cook made us a couple of delicious breakfasts for a very moderate amount of money. \nA couple of things to note - there are security surveillance cameras in common areas which was a bit odd for our privacy. Also, the 2 bedrooms on the 3D level are reachable only by outdoors spiral staircases.  There is a wonderful roof terrace between these rooms.  \nOverall, we found this to be an excellent and reasonably priced property."

There is one self-contained bed-room for the guest. He keeps house neat and clean though he lives alone, which is very good trait on his part.\r\nHe seems a little casual in his life. He has yet not updated his Cell number on the Airbnb and I had a tough time getting in touch with him for the first time before my visit. But once I was able to have his contact details, he was extremely prompt in his response. I will certainly look forward to stay with him again. "

Carlos floor is not like the photos, its better!\r\n\r\nIn a secure area with all basic needs, restaurants, coffee shops and some entertainment centers, just few minutes walking from the floor. At night the area is quiet, so you can rest easily.\r\n\r\nIts always clean, tidy, and with positive vibe that is a very good value added. The guest bedroom clean for us, with private bathroom, and all the necesities you need. \r\n\r\nDefinitely if you want a better experience staying in Mexico, do not hesitate to stay at Carlos floor, he will give you the best advices about Mexico City.\r\n\r\nThe next time im going to Mexico, im sure where im going to stay for sure!\r\n\r\nCheers!"

Carlos as a host is incredible! He is super laid back and incredibly friendly. If you plan on staying more than a few days (like I did) he definitely makes you feel like the place is your own and you can really settle in. He knows the area incredibly well, has tons of great suggestions, and is very attentive if there is anything you need. The space itself is in a great location within close walking distance to shopping, restaurants, super market, movie theater, and the metro station. The room was comfortable and clean and includes lots of storage (drawers, closet, etc) and a private bathroom. The common areas are always clean and incredibly spacious. Also, if you can't live without WiFi Carlos has you covered. It's fast and reliable and the one day it was out I let Carlos know and he responded and had it fixed in a matter of minutes. You really can't go wrong with this amazing host, great room, and convenient location! "

No est\u00e1 en el centro ni en la zona tur\u00edstica, sino en un barrio muy mexicano, familiar y agradable. Todo est\u00e1 muy cerca (el supermercado, el WTC). Con el Metrobus puedes estar en 30 minutos en av Reforma. Carlos fue muy atento. 100% recomendable."

Rosy, Alberto y las chicas de cocina me atendieron muy bien, me hicieron sentir como en casa. La comida muy rica por cierto.\n\nEl hotel est\u00e1 en un muy buen punto, enfrente puedes tomar el metrobus, a cuatro cuadras est\u00e1 la estaci\u00f3n del metro, a unas 6 cuadras tienes el Parque M\u00e9xico y como a 7 el coraz\u00f3n de la condesa. La casa est\u00e1 en muy buenas condiciones, la limpieza de los cuartos y \u00e1reas comunes bastante bien.\n\nLo recomend\u00e9 a toda mi familia y amigos. Pienso volver cada vez que vaya al DF."

The place is located few blocks away from the Independence Angel in Reforma avenue with lots of restaurants and bars in the area. As an old building, the apartment has some mainte0ce problems like the lack of hot water in the shower and the shower drain pipe doesn't work well. This could be uncomfortable If you are staying for several days. To enhance the experience, I recommend to listen to 70's music while there."

All bad things could've gone away if he had the cordiality to take things into matter in a more professional way, but he didn't. Overall experience, bad bad bad.

The majority of the apartment is one large open floor plan that feels like something straight out of an Austin Powers movie. It has orange shag carpeting, floor to ceiling paneling with built in custom furniture, and oddly around 20 phones in the space! The apartment is a masterpiece of 70's woodwork, with endless small details such as built in light switches, doors that close without a frame to basically disappear, and marble fixtures in the bathroom. That said, while the apartment was clearly vibrant at one time in the past, it currently feels a bit tired. Fixtures seem to be breaking, one bathroom doesn't work, the small bedroom doesn't have curtains and seems to be filled with old, non functioning equipment such as a TV and hot water heater. If it weren't for how wild the space was, we would have been disappointed by the upkeep. On the whole, I feel the apartment was a decent value, and it is centrally located. But given the current mainte0ce of the space, I don't know that I could see myself staying there again."

The bed was great, the space was clean and the decor was superb!  Roberto was a great host and checked in whenever necessary and provided a seamless check out."

The built in cabinets, the tulip table, the Bertoia chairs -- all of this stuff is original and really, really beautiful. I was here for 2 weeks, and the place began to feel like home. It's a huge space, and definitely one of the most unique airbnb's I've ever been in. Roberto was as helpful as he could possibly be. When the internet wasn't quite as fast as I needed it to be (I work in software development), he immediately called to have the bandwidth increased. When I locked myself out of the apartment, he was there in 10 minutes with the keys. This airbnb is exactly what I'm looking for when I go to DF.  I'll certainly be coming back here to stay."

The location is very central to many areas though the neighborhood itself is not the most beautiful in CDMX.  The building  - actually a small office building that the original owner, Roberto's uncle helped build - could use some TLC but the apartment is very special.

Condesa was a perfect home base for us- lots to do in the neighborhood and adjoining neighborhoods nearby with a walk or even quicker taxi ride.  Great coffee at Cielito Querido right around the corner. Flat was as described, and was perfect for our family of four (2 adults, two kids, 6 and 3) with room for two or so more.\r\nOne thing I would point out, is that this is a rental, not a residence, and as such, kitchen is not as fully stocked as it would be if someone lived there at least part time.  No cork screw, for example!  We should have brought one, but we got by.\r\nAlso, tiny amenities like a bar of soap in the bathroom would have been nice.   Maybe a lit of a few local recommendations (shops, restaurants) would be nice, but we got by even without them, no problem\r\nTiny things aside, this place was awesome and we'd absolutely stay here again next time we're in DF.  Love the city, loved the neighborhood of Condesa."

They even stayed up until 2 in the morning for us to arrive so they could provide the keys and a welcome.\r\n\r\nI give 4 stars instead of 5 as the place itself was not worthy of 5 stars.  Little things like decor and quality of linens could be improved.  That said, they are all very acceptable and given the cost of the place I think this is a very good match and I recommend.\r\n\r\nAs another reviewer also noted, there is no soap/etc supplied. So make sure to bring your own.  They provide plenty of towels/toilet paper/etc."

The house is situated in one of the best areas of the city with juice bars, great restaurants, live music and dog adoption only a matter of minutes away. Julian and Costanza are both lovely and interesting people and if we ever had a problem they were always on hand. The shared roof terrace is a great little sun trap and a real bonus, and the best thing is you bump into other people that are staying in the block who all have an interesting reason for being in the city. A great apartment, in a great location and run by great people. That's everything you could ask for in an airbnb. Thanks guys!"

It was dirty to my Airbnb standards and was not a comfortable stay. There is no padding underneath the carpet in the bedrooms and the bed is not comfortable and old. For the price compared to other airbnbs in the area it is quite high. The shower does not drain well.  There are bugs that fly in from the shower bathroom. You have to keep it open since there is no ventilation. We had problems the 1st day with the high speed internet and had to wait till the next day to fix the problem.  There is a Handiman on sight if any problems are to go wrong only during working hours. The communication with the host was great. "

She greeted us on arrival and was full of helpful hints and tips about the neighbourhood.  We had a couple of minor issues with the flat while we were there, but all were quickly and efficiently sorted by Constanza when we informed her.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood was wonderful.  It felt safe, and was full of fun bars, restaurants, cafes and shops.\r\n\r\nThe flat was large, bright and comfortable.  The rooftop terrace was lovely as well."

Ainda bem que neste caso encontramos exatamente o que foi prometido. E com muitas comodidades adicionais: um bonito terra\u00e7o onde era poss\u00edvel tamb\u00e9m lavar e secar as roupas, uma cozinha muito bem equipada (e com tudo funcio0do muito bem ...). Todo o necess\u00e1rio foi fornecido, desde o sab\u00e3o em p\u00f3 at\u00e9 o creme dental! Fomos muito bem recebidos e orientados por Jesus e Constanza (pena que n\u00e3o tivemos contato com Julian), com muita aten\u00e7\u00e3o e simpatia. O apartamento \u00e9 muito bem localizado, em um bairro art decco muito bonito e charmoso, e perto de tudo que precisamos. Passeamos muito pelos arredores.

Il est situ\u00e9 dans un quartier tr\u00e8s sympathique, o\u00f9 on trouve facilement des restaurants et une bonne boulangerie (Ficelle).\nPetit b\u00e9mol : comme tous les logements \u00e0 Mexico, il est mal isol\u00e9, on entend les gens dans la rue (tr\u00e8s calme) et les autres habitants de l'immeuble, ainsi que la pompe qui rempli la cuve d'eau tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t le matin."

Muy limpio.\nPero hay mucho ruido proveniente de los otros apartamentos.(del mismo edificio)  Si eres joven, parrandero y trasnochador, no hay problema, estaras en la onda.  Pero si eres turismo mas tranquilo, Te acuestas  despues de las 11.00 y te levantas  temprano, para aprovechar el dia,  no es la mejor opcion.\nPor lo demas, muy seguro y huele riquisimo el edificio."

Very safe, very friendly, very lovely area. 2.Communication with Julian and his helpers was super easy over (Hidden by Airbnb) . Check in was a breeze, they brought us more pillows when asked and I felt we were very well cared for. 3. The fridge was stocked with bottled waters which was a very nice touch. 4.Roof deck was a nice amenity, although it was undergoing renovations while we were there.\n\nNow for the not so good:\n\n1. Noise level was off the charts. It was like the apartment was on the street, the construction seemed to be happening in the apartment. We heard everything that was happening in the apartment upstairs, which in our case happened to be a kid crying 24/7. On Mondays they set up a charming little market outside the apartment, but that means that at 6am they are banging metal tubes. Suffice to say I didn't sleep well any of the nights there. Julian and Airbnb were very responsive about the issue, but it was definitely a bummer. 2. Seating surfaces are terrible. The futons in the living room are incredibly hard and upright and are not comfortable at all. The two pink chairs were not much better. 3.Read the fine print, this apartment is not good for more than 3 ppl. Those futons are NOT OK for sleeping on. They are hard, lumpy, and will give you back problems. 4. Needs to be repainted, the walls are all scuffed and chipped and need a little TLC. \n\nOverall, it's a decent airbnb for the price, but it definitely has it's issues so just be aware that you are getting what you pay for. I wouldn't necessarily call it a bargain but it's totally suitable for a group of students."

The communication between Constanza and our group was extremely prompt and helpful. They left a lot of drinking water for us and even re-upped mid-stay, very much appreciated. \n\nThere was heavy construction on the intersection during our stay, but it absolutely did not present any problem to us. If you travel to a city and are sensitive to noise, bring earplugs! The futons were fine as well, but we are very casual, and not picky. Laundry access was amazing, and although the rooftop patio was undergoing renovations, we enjoyed just relaxing up there after a long day of seeing the sights. \n\nThe neighbourhood is fantastic, so much within a couple blocks, but this street itself is quite residential. It is not beside any clubs or restaurants. Can't wait to go back to CDMX, would stay with Julian anytime."
